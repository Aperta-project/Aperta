  <h3>
    Institutional Fee Support
  </h3>

  <p>
    Participating institutions have arrangements with PLOS to administer payment for partial or full
    publication feeds for their institutions' authors.
    To be eligible, authors must be a corresponding author affiliated with the
    institution or agency in the
    <a href="https://www.plos.org/about/get-involved-2/institutional-account-program/" target="_blank">Institutional Account Program</a>
    (fully paid or restricted). Authors who need to request additional support should apply for
    <a href="https://www.plos.org/publications/publication-fees/plos-publication-fee-assistance/" target="_blank">PLOS Publication Fee Assistance</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authors may also be eligible for direct funding from their institution or funder,
    which may be different from the PLOS Institutional program.
    See additional
    <a href="https://www.plos.org/publications/publication-fees/open-access-funds/" target="_blank">funds</a>
    for examples.
    To confirm amounts and details of funding and eligibility, contact the organization as indicated.
