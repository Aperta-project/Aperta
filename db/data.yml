      2. Author, Arthur from PLOS

      Abstract:
      <p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p>

      ***EDIT THIS LETTER BEFORE SENDING****

      Dear Dr. [LAST NAME],

      Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript entitled “[PAPER TITLE]” for review by [JOURNAL NAME]. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, yours was assessed and discussed by the [JOURNAL NAME] editors. In this case, your article was also assessed by an Academic Editor with relevant expertise and several independent reviewers. Based on the reviews, I regret that we will not be able to accept this manuscript for publication in the journal.

      The reviews are attached, and we hope they may help you should you decide to revise the manuscript for submission elsewhere. I am sorry that we cannot be more positive on this occasion.

      While we cannot consider your manuscript further for publication in [JOURNAL NAME], we very much appreciate your wish to present your work in an Open Access publication and so suggest, as an alternative, submitting to PLOS ONE (www.plosone.org).

      PLOS ONE is a peer-reviewed journal that accepts scientifically sound primary research. The review process at PLOS ONE differs from other PLOS journals in that it does not judge the perceived impact of the work or whether this falls within a particular area of research. Rather, it focuses on whether the study has been performed and reported to high scientific and ethical standards, and whether the data support the conclusions. This approach helps to eliminate the rejection cycles that authors commonly encounter when submitting to one journal after another, ultimately speeding the path to publication.

      If you would like the editors of this journal to consider your work please login at the relevant journal submission site (details about the journal and a link to the submission site can be found at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submit-now). Please note that the journals are editorially independent and we cannot submit your article on your behalf. Once at the relevant submission site, log in and choose 'Submit Manuscript' from the list of Author Tasks, selecting the article type 'Research Article'. Please include the [JOURNAL NAME] decision letter, including all editorial and reviewer comments, in your submission. This letter can be uploaded as an “Other” file in the file inventory of your submission form and will assist the PLOS ONE editors to assess your manuscript as quickly as possible.

      I hope you have found this review process constructive and that you will consider publishing your work in PLOS ONE.  Thank you for your support of PLOS and of Open Access publishing.

      until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers'
      comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent for further evaluation
      by the reviewers. \n\nYour revisions should address the specific points made
      by each reviewer. Please also submit a cover letter and a point-by-point response
      to all of the reviewers' comments that indicates the changes you have made to
      the manuscript. You should also cite any additional relevant literature that

      PLOS’ data policy requires that you make available all data used to draw conclusions

      include any data used in your manuscript either in appropriate repositories,
      within the body of the manuscript, or as supporting information (NB this includes
      any numerical values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.). For

      resubmission, the editors will assess the advance your revised manuscript represents
      over work published prior to its resubmission in reaching a decision regarding

      and decide whether to consult further with an Academic Editor. If the editors
      and Academic Editor feel that the revised manuscript remains appropriate for
      the journal and that the revisions are sufficient to warrant further consideration,
      we generally will send the manuscript for re-review. We aim to consult the same
      Academic Editor and reviewers for revised manuscripts but may consult others
      if needed.\n\nWe expect to receive your revised manuscript within two months.
      Please email us ([JOURNAL STAFF EMAIL]) to discuss this if you have any questions
      or concerns, or would like to request an extension. \n\nAt this stage, your
      manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal. Please
      note that unless we receive the revised manuscript within this timeframe, your
      submission may be closed and the manuscript would no longer be ‘under consideration’
      at [JOURNAL NAME]. We will of course be in touch before this action is taken.
      Please rest assured that this is merely an administrative step - you may still
      submit your revised submission after your file is closed, but will need to do
      so as a new submission, referencing the previous tracking number.\n\nPlease
      notify us by email if you do not wish to revise your manuscript for [JOURNAL
      NAME] and instead wish to pursue publication elsewhere, so that we may end consideration
      of the manuscript at [JOURNAL NAME].\n\nIf you do still intend to submit a revised
      version of your manuscript, please log in at http://www.aperta.tech.  On the
      ‘Your Manuscripts’ page, click the title of your manuscript to access and edit

      It’s helpful for you to take a look through this at this stage, and to align
      your revision with our requirements; should your paper be eventually accepted,
      this will save everyone time at the acceptance stage. \n\nThank you again for

    - Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
      Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
      an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
      book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
      with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
      recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
      of Lorem Ipsum.

    - Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
      Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
      an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
      book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
      with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
      recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
      of Lorem Ipsum.

    - <p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating
      rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of
      the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys;
      covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population
      size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical
      range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying
      less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting
      intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding
      infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining
      African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core
      elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for
      ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7].

      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted.

      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>

This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>

Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>

The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>

Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively.

      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely.

      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>

        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>).

        <span class="None">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span>

        <span class="None">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants&#x2014; taxonomically and functionally unique&#x2014;are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002&#x2013;2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth&#x2019;s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current &#x201C;known&#x201D; and &#x201C;possible&#x201D; range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002&#x2013;2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC&#x2019;s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated&#x2014;elephants occur where people do not&#x2014;and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International&#x2019;s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the &#x201C;Known&#x201D; range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region&#x2019;s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5&#x2013;1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867&#x2013;187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30&#x2013;50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouch&#xE9; et al.&#x2019;s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon&#x2019;s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park &#x2013; but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] &#x2013; where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"/><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the &#x201C;country&#x201D; variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED&#x2019;s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>

        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China&#x2019;s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation.

Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 26%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>).

        <span class="None">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span>

        <span class="None">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

        <span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002&#x2013;2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth&#x2019;s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current &#x201C;known&#x201D; and &#x201C;possible&#x201D; range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 26%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002&#x2013;2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC&#x2019;s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated&#x2014;elephants occur where people do not&#x2014;and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International&#x2019;s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the &#x201C;Known&#x201D; range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region&#x2019;s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5&#x2013;1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867&#x2013;187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30&#x2013;50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouch&#xE9; et al.&#x2019;s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon&#x2019;s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park &#x2013; but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] &#x2013; where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"/><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the &#x201C;country&#x201D; variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED&#x2019;s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China&#x2019;s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent. </span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 26%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>

        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>

        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent. </span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span>

        <span class="None">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002&#x2013;2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth&#x2019;s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current &#x201C;known&#x201D; and &#x201C;possible&#x201D; range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 26%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002&#x2013;2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC&#x2019;s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated&#x2014;elephants occur where people do not&#x2014;and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International&#x2019;s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the &#x201C;Known&#x201D; range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region&#x2019;s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5&#x2013;1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867&#x2013;187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30&#x2013;50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouch&#xE9; et al.&#x2019;s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon&#x2019;s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park &#x2013; but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] &#x2013; where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"/><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the &#x201C;country&#x201D; variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED&#x2019;s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>

        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China&#x2019;s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa&#x2019;s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>).

        <span class="None">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed.

        <span class="None">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 26%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen</span>
        <span class="page_number">.</span>
        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>

        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>).

        <span class="None">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span>

        <span class="None">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      </p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002&#x2013;2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p><p class="Body A">In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p><p class="Body A">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth&#x2019;s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p><p class="Body A">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p><p class="Body A">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p><p class="Body A">The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current &#x201C;known&#x201D; and &#x201C;possible&#x201D; range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 26%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002&#x2013;2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC&#x2019;s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated&#x2014;elephants occur where people do not&#x2014;and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p><p class="Body A">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International&#x2019;s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p><p class="Body A">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the &#x201C;Known&#x201D; range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region&#x2019;s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p><p class="Body A">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5&#x2013;1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867&#x2013;187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30&#x2013;50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989<span class="page_number"> </span>[41].</p><p class="Body A">
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
      </p><p class="Body A">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouch&#xE9; et al.&#x2019;s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon&#x2019;s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park &#x2013; but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012<span class="page_number"> </span>[52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically.</p><p class="Body A">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p><p class="Body A">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] &#x2013; where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"/><span class="None">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the &#x201C;country&#x201D; variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED&#x2019;s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p><p class="Body A">
        <span class="None">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years</span>
        <span class="page_number"> </span>
        <span class="None">[47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer.

        <span class="None"> This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span>

        <span class="None">[67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span>

        <span class="None">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China&#x2019;s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span>

Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span>

      class=\"First Paragraph\">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial
      public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous
      studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical,
      and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse
      and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society
      and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently.
      For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed
      in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform
      distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive
      numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can
      promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random
      variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution
      effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion
      effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous
      investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into
      account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment
      with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of
      strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by
      weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that
      heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>\n</div>\n<div
      class=\"teidiv2\" id=\"introduction\">\n<h4><span class=\"head\">Introduction</span></h4>\n<p
      class=\"First Paragraph\">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies
      for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s
      theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However,
      in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies.
      One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary
      anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these
      universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating
      evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict
      between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several
      players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously
      [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public
      whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied
      by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all
      players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with
      the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which
      causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>\n<p>Aiming at solving the above
      tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality,
      several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15],
      reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so
      on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful
      mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology
      of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how
      cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks
      [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for
      solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it
      is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often
      equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern
      society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently
      [28-30].</p>\n<p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into
      consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial
      PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator
      is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is
      equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative
      behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution
      of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution

      class=\"First Paragraph\">In this article, the public goods game is considered
      on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions.
      At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection
      randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while
      defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent
      that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the
      model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of
      � is independent of that of other players.</p>\n<p>For the sake of accelerating
      the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics,
      it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which
      involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all
      contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting
      public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the
      payoff of player � is</p>\n<p>�</p>\n<p>where � denotes the strategy of player
      �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>\n<p>The Monte Carlo
      (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the
      evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy
      update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly.
      Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the
      strategy of player � with a probability</p>\n<p>�</p>\n<p>where � denotes the
      cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational
      decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution
      of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of
      player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented
      in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction
      of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient
      time of 55000 MCS.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"teidiv2\" id=\"results\">\n<h4><span
      class=\"head\">Results</span></h4>\n<p class=\"First Paragraph\">Firstly, it
      is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results
      presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for
      different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction
      of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to
      the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial
      strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is,
      the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily,
      which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds,
      the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which
      restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments
      render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which
      in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>\n<p>Fig.
      1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when
      � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While
      �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators
      is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>\n<p>While
      figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship
      between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when�
      is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure
      2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The
      asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals
      that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile,
      the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators
      � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will
      survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve
      in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase
      of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the
      phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population
      consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates
      that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore,
      to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform
      distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore,
      the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>\n<p>Fig.
      2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement
      factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that
      the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators
      � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and �
      effectively.</p>\n<p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the
      typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure
      it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the
      beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form
      into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors
      reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold
      the cooperation strategy.</p>\n<p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions
      on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red
      and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure
      shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution,
      but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain
      the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the
      end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation
      strategy.</p>\n<p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and
      enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken
      into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �,
      the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly
      the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through
      the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>\n<p>Fig. 4. Relationship between
      asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding
      to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into
      account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared
      to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that
      cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>\n<p>Comparing
      the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion
      effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy
      imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will
      discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5
      shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment
      (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left
      panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When
      only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state
      is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy
      and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely
      distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued
      �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently,
      the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through
      statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the
      smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform
      distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment
      decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity
      of investment once again.</p>\n<p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment
      corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding
      to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the
      figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution
      of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however,
      when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous
      uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies
      a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case,
      as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators
      � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"teidiv2\"

      Paragraph\">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous
      investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all,
      the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement
      factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the
      larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively,
      and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be.
      In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous
      investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration.
      Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with
      that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that
      the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction
      of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the
      result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of
      promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"teidiv2\" id=\"acknowledgments\">\n<h4><span

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9].

      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>

The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>
