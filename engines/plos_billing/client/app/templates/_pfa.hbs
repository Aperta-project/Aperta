          PLOS Publication Fee Assistance (PFA Program)
        </h3>

        <p>
          PLOS believes that lack of funds should not be a barrier to Open Access publication.
          PFA is intended for authors who do not have sufficient fund
          available to support publication fees. PLOS expects authors to exhaust all
          alternative funding sources before applying for PFA.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Have you investigated if Open Access Funds are available from your institutional library?
          </li>
          <li>
            Have you investigated if institutional discretionary funds are available to support your research publishing?
            For example, have you asked your Dean or Department Head for funding support?
          </li>
          <li>
            Have you investigated if there are discretionary funds in your co-authorsâ€™ grant to support your fee?
          </li>
          <li>
            For European researchers, have you asked your librarian if article processing grants from research funders are available?
            For example, from Research Councils UK (RCUK), the German Research Foundation (DFG) or The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
