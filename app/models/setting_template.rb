# SettingTemplate is the mapping between
# an instance of a thing and the type of settings that
# it should have.
#
# For instance, the SimilarityCheck Card (in this case meaning a Card whose name
# is 'SimilarityCheck') has an IthenticateAutomation setting that needs to be
# edited from a TaskTemplate associated to the card. The IthenticateAutomation
# settings are an enumeration of values that need special validation.
# SettingTemplate will map from a key (in this case
# 'TaskTemplate:SimilarityCheck') to the names and classes of the settings for
# that key ('Setting' and 'ithenticate')
#
# SettingTemplate also handles defaults for a given setting, and holds the
# enumeration of possible values that could be assigned to a Setting via
# possible_setting_values. Note that some settings will be 'global', and some
# will be associated to a specific journal. Initially we're only using global
# settings.
class SettingTemplate < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ViewableModel
  # For a SettingTemplate the 'value' is really the default value the Setting
  # should take, but the extra specificity didn't seem worth having to discard
  # the mixin.
