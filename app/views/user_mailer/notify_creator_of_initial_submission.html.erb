      Dear <%= @author.full_name %>,
    </p>
    <p class="message">
      Thank you for your submission, "<%= @title %>", which will 
      now be passed to the editors to determine whether your scientific findings meet the criteria
      for peer review at <%= @journal.name %>. The staff editors may also seek advice from an
      Academic Editor with relevant expertise.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the editorial evaluation is positive, the manuscript will be returned to you ahead of
      initiating peer review for you to submit statements relating to ethical approval, funding,
      data and competing interests. This additional information will need to satisfy PLOSâ€™ policies
      and be made available to reviewers.
    </p>
