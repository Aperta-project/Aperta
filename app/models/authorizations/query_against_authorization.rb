    # == Constructor Arguments
    # * authorization - the Authorizations::Authorization object we should
    #           query against
    # * klass - the class that we're looking for authorization against. This \
    #           is expected to be the model class for the 'target' argument.
    # * target - the target object, scope (ActiveRecord::Relation), or class \
    #            that we are querying against.
    # * assignments - a collection of assignments for the user that provide
    #            access to objects that we're looking for (e.g. see klass)
    # * assigned_to_klass - the class the user is assigned. This is often \
    #            the same as +authorization.assignment_to+ but may differ if
    #            we were assigned to a subclass so it's passed in separately
    # * permissible_states - a collection of states (as strings) that should
    #            be queried against
    # * state_column - the name of the state column on +klass+ to check
    #            +permissible_states+ against
    # * state_join - the name of the association to delegate to as a symbol
    #

          From looking at the association #{authorization.via.inspect} on
          #{assigned_to_klass} its inverse cannot be determined.

          You may need to specify an an :inverse_of option on that association
          as well as ensure that the inverse association on #{@klass} does
          indeed exist.

          So sorry to be difficult here, but this information will really help
          us – the authorization sub-system minions – return the right
          records.
