# UploadServer is used to mimick Amazon S3 and handle file uploads when running
# integration/feature specs.
#
# The reason this exists is because uploading files in a browser (e.g. through
# Selenium) POST/PUTs them directly to Amazon S3 (per the S3_URL env
# var). Due to this VCR cannot be used to intercept those requests and stub
# their responses. This also prevents the uploads from successfully completing
# when running feature specs.
#
# Additional Notes:
#
# * uploading a file will store it in-memory, you can later GET that file back
# * be sure to call UploadServer.clear_all_uploads to eliminate bleed over from
#   one test to another.
