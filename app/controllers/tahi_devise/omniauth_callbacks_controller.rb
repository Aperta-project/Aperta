    # that email addresses are private. The user can change their email address to be public,
    # and we can get it back, but let's face it, nobody's going to do that. Even though we
    # are reading "limited access data", the field is private and this prevents Orcid
    # from sending us the email address.
    #
    # So, redirect to a page that prefills any orcid profile information and collects email.
