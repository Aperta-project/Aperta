    Publications fees (also referred to as “Article Processing Charges” or APCs) help PLOS recover 
    the costs of publication — including peer review management, journal production and online hosting and archiving. 
    All content published by PLOS is published Open Access and is freely available online for researchers &amp; readers 
    to read, distribute and reuse. 
  </p>
  <p>Publication fees vary by journal and are payable for articles upon acceptance.
    The effective publication fee charged is based on the manuscript submission date.
