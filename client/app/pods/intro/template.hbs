    To provide Open Access, PLOS uses a business model to offset expenses -
    including those of peer review management, journal production and online hosting and archiving -
    by charging a publication fee to the authors, institutions or funders for each article published.
  </p>

  <p>
    Publication fees vary by journal and are payable for articles upon acceptance.
