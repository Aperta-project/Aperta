  # Hokay let's talk about ordering. Ember data makes a POST to create
  # a new author (or group author). In response, it expects to see one
  # Author, or one GroupAuthor, because that's what it requested. But
  # We know that the *position* of every other author on the paper may
  # be changed at the insertion of a single new author. So we send
  # back the whole list of authors. This makes sense. But Ember Data,
  # because it is expecting one (only one) NEW author, it takes the
  # first thing we send it and inserts it, and then upserts the rest.
  # In order to make sure it INSERTS the NEW record, we order so that
  # the highest ID is first. This is sloppy and confusing, and we
  # apologize. Sam and Jerry <sam@mutuallyhuman.com>

  # response: {authors: [{id: 1, blah}, {id: 2, position: 2}]}
