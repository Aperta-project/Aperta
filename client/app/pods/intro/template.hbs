  <p>
    To provide Open Access, PLOS uses a business model to offset expenses -
    including those of peer review management, journal production and online hosting and archiving -
    by charging a publication fee to the authors, institutions or funders for each article published.
  </p>

  <p>
    Publication fees vary by journal and are payable for articles upon acceptance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    {{#each journals as |journal|}}
      <li>
        <i>{{journal.name}}</i>
        ${{journal.price}} USD
      </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>

  <p>
    Since its inception, PLOS has administered and provided individual fee support.
