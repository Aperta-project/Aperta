              <text>All animal work must have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. If your study involved non-human primates, you must provide details regarding animal welfare and steps taken to ameliorate suffering; this is in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, "<a href="http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/the-use-of-non-human-primates-in-research/" target="_blank">The use of non-human primates in research.</a>" The relevant guidelines followed and the committee that approved the study should be identified in the ethics statement.<br/>If anesthesia, euthanasia or any kind of animal sacrifice is part of the study, please include briefly in your statement which substances and/or methods were applied. Manuscripts describing studies that use death as an endpoint will be subject to additional ethical considerations, and may be rejected if they lack appropriate justification for the study or consideration of humane endpoints.<br/>Please enter the name of your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or other relevant ethics board, and indicate whether they approved this research or granted a formal waiver of ethical approval. Also include an approval number if one was obtained.</text>
