<p>Dear <%= @author.full_name %>,</p>

<p>
  Thank you for your submission to <%= @journal.name %>, which will now be assessed
  by the editors to determine whether your manuscript meets the criteria
  for peer review. We may seek advice from an Academic Editor with relevant
  expertise.
</p>

<p>
  If our initial evaluation is positive, we will contact you to request
  statements relating to ethical approval, funding, data and competing
  interests ahead of initiating peer review. This additional information is
  required to satisfy PLOSâ€™ policies and will be made available to editors
  and reviewers. If you anticipate that you will be unavailable during the
  next week or two, please provide us with an additional person of contact by
  return email.
