    {{!-- This empty div only exists as an ember-wormhole target. In the initial
    use case a child component - the card-editor/editor - needs to add buttons
    into the DOM higher up for layout and styling, but should manage those
    buttons in its own template. The wormhole is a perfect fit for that type of
    thing. --}}
