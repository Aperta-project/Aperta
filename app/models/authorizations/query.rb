  # Query represents the entry-point into the Authorizations sub-system. It's
  # where you start if you want to find accessible objects or check access
  # of an existing object.
  #
  # == Example - Find all papers that a user can view
  #
  #     Authorizations::Query.new(
  #       permission: :view,
  #       target: Paper.all,
  #       user: User.find(14),
  #       participations_only: false
  #     ).all
  #
  # == Example - Find all papers that a user can view and is participating in
  #
  #     Authorizations::Query.new(
  #       permission: :view,
  #       target: Paper.all,
  #       user: User.find(14),
  #       participations_only: true
  #     ).all
  #
  # == More Examples
  #
  # For more examples of what's possible see the specs in spec/authorizations/
  # directory.
  #
  # == More information on participations_only
  #
  # participations_only is used to check if any of the roles a user is
  # assigned to should be considered an active participant as opposed to
  # somebody with access. This is useful for displaying relevant papers
  # on a user's dashboard.
  #
  # Some users, like Journal-level Staff Admins, have access to a lot of papers
  # in the system, but they aren't participating in many of them. Maybe even
  # none of them. When trying to determine what to show on the dashboard it
  # may be relevant to display papers they are actively participating in.
  #
  # == Deep Dive!
  #
  # The query generates _a lot_ of SQL. The SQL looks complex, but it's
  # conceptually pretty simple. There are four things that need to be done.
  # Consider this code:
  #
  #       Authorizations::Query.new(
  #         user: User.find_by_username("joe"),
  #         permission: :view,
  #         target: Paper.find(99).tasks
  #       ).all
  #
  #    Joe is trying to get a list of all of the tasks on Paper 99 that he
  #    can view. Here are the four steps we need to consider:
  #
  # ==== Step 1
  #
  # For a given user and permission we need to find all of the \
  # Assignment(s) that could give the user access to kind of object \
  # (e.g. Task, Paper, Journal, etc).
  #
  # This means that we need to find all assignments for Joe, JOIN on
  # roles, JOIN on permissions, JOIN on permission_states and then only include
  # those records where the permissions.applies_to matches Task.
  #
  # Remember, this is just to get a list of Assignment(s) that _might_ give Joe
  # access. We don't know for sure yet, onto step 2.
  #
  # Note: the PermissibleAssignmentsQuery represents Step 1.
  #
  # ==== Step 2
  #
  # Once we have the set of assignments which could give a user access to \
  # an object we need to then look at all of the Authorization paths. The
  # Authorization paths tell us how to get from the kind of object the user
  # is assigned to, to the kind of object that the user is querying for.
  #
  # There may be multiple paths. For example, if Joe was looking to access
  # Paper 99 he may be assigned to a Journal. If so, then the path may be
  # the Journal's "has_many :papers" association, but if Joe is assigned
  # to a Task (say he's a Reviewer assigned to a ReviewerReportTask) then the
  # path may be thru Task's "belongs_to :paper" association.
  #
  # Because there are many ways to get from point A (what the user is \
  # assigned to) to point B (what the user is querying for) we need to
  # dynamically query all of those paths because we don't know ahead of time
  # which path will give him access.
  #
  # Once we look at all of the paths we will the set of the objects that
  # Joe is authorized to view. Well mostly. Up until know we haven't taken
  # into consideration PermissionRequirement(s). Let's do that next.
  #
  # Note: the ObjectsViaAuthorizationsQuery represents Step 2. Internally,
  # it will use ObjectsAuthorizedViaNNNQuery objects to do the heavy
  # lifting where NNN is BelongsTo, Collection, Self, or Through.
  #
  # ==== Step 3
  #
  # Now that we have all of the objects that a user may be authorized to see
  # we need to further reduce the results to exclude any that have
  # PermissionRequirement(s) that the user doesn't have.
  #
  # The result of this is final set of objects that a user can see. For Joe,
  # it would be a list of all of the tasks he could view on Paper 99.
  #
  # At this point we have a set of records which contains two key pieces of
  # information: the object id and the permission actions. E.g. we may have
  # a result set that looks like this:
  #
  #     id       permission_actions
  #   ------  |  -------------------
  #      11   |    view:*, edit: unsubumitted
  #      47   |    view:*, edit: unsubmitted
  #      33   |    view:*, edit: unsubmitted
  #
  # Note: the ObjectsPermissibleByRequiredPermissionsQuery handles this work.
  #
  # ==== Step 4
  #
  # Up to this point all of the queries and subqueries have used only the
  # columns that they need to do their job. This wasn't mentioned earlier in
  # these docs because it didnt' seem relevant. Now it's relevant.
  #
  # If you look at the table of results in Step 3 above there are only
  # two fields. We need to take the tasks that Joe can view and hydrate
  # them. So, step 4 involves JOINing those ids back on the tasks table
  # and selecting _all_ of the columns.
  #
  # That's all step 4 does.
  #
  # Note: HydrateObjectsQuery and HydrateObjects handle step 4.
  #
  # ==== Summary
  #
  # There are parts of the Authorization query which are static and there
  # are parts which are dynamic. The code to generate the dynamic bits does
  # get a bit messy because it is doing some complicated things (converting
  # Ruby code to efficient SQL code), but in reality only the four steps
  # above are being applied.
  #
  # P.S. This code works with Single Table Inheritance (STI) and that is
  # an area that also makes some Ruby code more cmoplex as well as the
  # resulting SQL complex. Fortunately, it's not a problem for the database.
  #
  # == Notes
  #
  # The Authorizations::UserHelper module provides convenience methods
  # that wrap this object. Check those before using this object directly.
