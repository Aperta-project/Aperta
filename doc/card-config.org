**Reviewer Reports
Reviewer reports will link to two different kinds of cards, based on which type of task made them.
- [X] Delete the Cards where the name is 'ReviewerReportTask' and 'FrontMatterReviewerReportTask' from the data.yml
- [X] Migrate FrontMatterReviewerReportTask and ReviewerReportTask reports to different cards
    The tasks themselves don't have cards, but there is a type of card for each different report.
    Another thing to note: There is *not* a FrontMatterReviewerReport class, even though we have
    a card by that name in the seeds now.  Be careful.
- [X] Change ReviewerReportTaskCreator to assign the correct type of Card when creating a ReviewerReport
- [ ] Migration: associate ReviewerReports to the appropriate kinds of cards, migrate answers too
- [X] ReviewerReportTask on the client needs to load the appropriate card for its Report, like authors, etc.
- [ ] Does the ReviewerReportsController#create action ever actually get called?

**Open Questions, todos
- [ ] Seed cards for every journal in the system. Need to restructure the way the seed runs
to avoid having to pass a journal argument into the myriad rake tasks
