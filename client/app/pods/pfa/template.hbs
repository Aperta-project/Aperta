      <h3>PLOS Publication Fee Assistance (PFA Program)</h3>

      <p>
        The PLOS Publication Fee Assistance (PFA) program is intended for authors unable to 
        pay all or part of their publication fees and who can demonstrate financial need.
      </p><p>
        Authors must apply for PFA during article submission.  Requests made during the 
        review process or after acceptance will not be considered.  Authors cannot apply 
        for fee assistance by email or by writing to the journal editors.
      </p><p>
        Authors should exhaust all
        <a href="https://www.plos.org/open-access-funds">alternative funding sources</a>
        before applying for PFA, including the author’s or co-authors’ institution, 
        institutional library, government agencies and research funders. Funding disclosure 
        information provided by authors will be used as part of the PFA application review.
      </p><p>
        Applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. To apply, 
        complete the application during the submission process below. Decisions on PFA are 
        usually made within 10 business days. Information about an applicant's application 
        for fee assistance will not be disclosed to journal editors or reviewers. 
        PLOS publication decisions will continue to be based solely on editorial criteria.  
        View PFA for additional information.

          Have you investigated if Open Access Funds are available from your institutional library?
        </li>
        <li>
          Have you investigated if institutional discretionary funds are available to support your research publishing?
          For example, have you asked your Dean or Department Head for funding support?
        </li>
        <li>
          Have you investigated if there are discretionary funds in your co-authors’ grant to support your fee?
        </li>
        <li>
          For European researchers, have you asked your librarian if article processing grants from research funders are available?
          For example, from Research Councils UK (RCUK), the German Research Foundation (DFG) or The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
