JIRA issue: link-to-jira

#### What this PR does:

Explain in a few sentences what functionality changed, and how. Don't be afraid
to give a little extra detail. The Reviewer is going to read the original
ticket, but this can point them in the right direction.

Can your changes be *seen* by a user? Then add a screenshot. Is it an
interaction?  Perhaps a quick recording?

#### Notes

Are there any surprises? Anything that was particularly difficult, or clever, or
made you nervous, and should get particular attention during review? Call it
out.
