      <h4>{{paper.journal.name}} Submission Process</h4>

      <p>
        To facilitate submission, we have broken down the process.  Initially {{paper.journal.name}}
        editors only need your manuscript, with figures and supporting information, and a cover
        letter to evaluate your submission.  You will be asked for additional information only if
        your manuscript is sent out to peer reviewers.
      </p>
