Description:
    Generate a Tahi task in an existing Tahi plugin.

    New Tahi plugins should begin with the string `tahi-` and will be part
    of the `Tahi` module.

    Task names should be snake-cased and will have the string `task`
    appended appropriately.

    The tahi-task Ember blueprint is automatically invoked, and will generate
    all of the JavaScript files relevant to the task.

    The data:update_journal_task_types Rake task is automatically invoked, and will add
    the new task to all journals.

Example:
    rails generate tahi:task author_portrait tahi-author

    This will create:
        engines/tahi-author/app/models/tahi/author/author_portrait_task.rb
        engines/tahi-author/app/policies/tahi/author/author_portrait_tasks_policy.rb
        engines/tahi-author/app/serializers/tahi/author/author_portrait_task_serializer.rb

    And invoke client/blueprints/tahi-task to create:
        engines/tahi-author/client/app/adapters/author-portrait-task.js
        engines/tahi-author/client/app/controllers/overlays/author-portrait.js
        engines/tahi-author/client/app/models/author-portrait-task.js
        engines/tahi-author/client/app/serializers/author-portrait-task.js
        engines/tahi-author/client/app/templates/overlays/author-portrait.hbs
        engines/tahi-author/client/app/views/overlays/author-portrait.js
