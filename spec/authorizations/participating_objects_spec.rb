describe <<-DESC.strip_heredoc do
  There are two kinds of visibility that pertain to the authorization
  sub-system:

    1) participating objects - these are the objects a user is considered
      to be actively participating in.

    2) accessible objects - these are the objects that a user has the
      authority to access, but that likely won't show up by default. E.g. a
      journal admin has access to all papers in the journal, but it probably
      doesn't make sense to populate their dashboard with all of them.

  Columns can be added to the roles table that provide hints to the
  authorization sub-system about what kinds of objects to include. The
  naming convention for each hinting column is:

     'participates_in_' + YourModel.table_name
