JIRA issue: link-to-jira

#### What this PR does:

Explain in a few sentences what functionality changed, and how. Don't be afraid
to give a little extra detail. The Reviewer is going to read the original
ticket, but this can point them in the right direction.

Can your changes be *seen* by a user? Then add a screenshot. Is it an
interaction?  Perhaps a quick recording?

#### Notes

Are there any surprises? Anything that was particularly difficult, or clever, or
made you nervous, and should get particular attention during review? Call it
out. Does the reviewer have to run a rake task?
