    <h4>{{model.journal.name}} Submission Process</h4>

    <p>
      To facilitate submission, we have broken down the process.  Initially {{model.journal.name}}
      editors only need your manuscript, with figures and supporting information, and a cover
      letter to evaluate your submission.  You will be asked for additional information only if
      your manuscript is sent out to peer reviewers.
