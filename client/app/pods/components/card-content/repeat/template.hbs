        When the repetition is new, it won't have an id. We must wait for the
        repetition to be saved before rendering the child content. Any
        requiredField answers are created eagerly, but we need to wait for the
        reptition to be saved to correctly associate them.

        None of that is something we need to worry about in the Card Preview
        though, since neither Repetitions nor Answers are actually persisted to
        the server.
