    <p>
      To provide Open Access, PLOS uses a business model to
      offset expenses - including those of peer review management,
      journal production and online hosting and archiving -
      by charging a publication fee to the authors, institutions
      or funders for each article published.
    </p>

    <p>
      Submissions to Special Collections are by invitation only
      and are subject to
      <a href="#">specific terms and charges</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have not received and read the
      PLOS Colletions Terms of Submission,
      or have not received specific submission instructions
      directing you to select this option,
      please contact
      <a href="mailto:collections@plos.org">colletions@plos.org</a>
      before proceeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Papers submitted for potential inclusion in a PLOS Special
      Collection are not eligible for the PLOS Publication Fee
      Assistance (PFA) Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      All papers that are submitted for inclusion in a Special
      Collection will be charged the Article Processing Charge
      of the relevant journal of publication plus a Collection
      Surcharge on publication:
