    - <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants— taxonomically
      and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack
      range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey
      dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000
      km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined
      by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range.
      The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than
      25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity,
      absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure
      are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest
      elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat
      must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels
      illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</span></p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>

      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>

Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration.

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>

      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>

For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>

The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>

The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>

This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>

      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed.

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior.

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions.

      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>

      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely.

      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed.

      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�.

In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be.

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>

      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>

Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively.

      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed.

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9].

      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update.

      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Fig. 4. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to � respectively when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account. The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>
      <p>Fig. 5. The steady distribution of investment corresponding to strategy evolution only (Left panel) and that corresponding to coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel), when �，�. From the figure, it can be found that when only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�, however, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. In conclusion, compared to the former case, as the heterogeneity of investment is weakened, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases in the case of coevolution.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Conclusions</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">To summarize, this article further explores the impact of heterogeneous investment on the evolution of cooperative behavior in spatial PGG. Above all, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when � varies has been presented, and it can be concluded that the larger value of � has the capacity to decrease the values of � and � effectively, and that the larger the value of� is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has also discussed the influence of heterogeneous investment when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, the conclusion can be naturally drawn that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment. Therefore, the result above further demonstrates that heterogeneous investment is capable of promoting cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9].

Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted.

      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed.

In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be.

      <h4><span class="head">Abstract</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatial public goods game remains a grand challenge across disciplines. In most previous studies, it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, and often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that players are diverse and heterogeneous when choosing actions in the rapidly developing modern society and researchers have shown more interest to the heterogeneity of players recently. For modeling the heterogeneous players without loss of generality, it is assumed in this work that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution, the mean value of which is equal to 1. The results of extensive numerical simulations convincingly indicate that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation. Specifically, a large value of the variance of the random variable can decrease the two critical values for the result of behavioral evolution effectively. Moreover, the larger the variance is, the better the promotion effect will be. In addition, this article has discussed the impact of heterogeneous investments when the coevolution of both strategy and investment is taken into account. Comparing the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment with that of strategy imitation only, we can conclude that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators by weakening the heterogeneity of investments, which further demonstrates that heterogeneous investments can promote cooperation in spatial public goods game.</p>

      <h4><span class="head">Introduction</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Cooperation and defection are two fundamental strategies for individuals confronted with every social dilemma [1-3]. According to Darwin’s theory of the origin of species, cooperation extinction is inevitable [4]. However, in the daily life, cooperation is abundantly observed in animal and human societies. One primary challenge in fields ranging from genetics and cell biology to evolutionary anthropology and behavioral economics is to explain the mechanism for these universal cooperative phenomena. Among the game theoretical approaches to investigating evolution of cooperation, one of the most popular frameworks to study the conflict between individuals is the so-called public goods game (PGG), in which several players decide whether or not to contribute to the common pool simultaneously [5-7]. In the model of PGG, cooperators contribute a fixed share to the public whereas defectors do not. Subsequently, all contributions are added up and multiplied by an enhancement factor�, then the total welfare is equally divided among all players irrespective of their strategies. Consequently, players are faced with the temptation of being free-riders and rational players invest nothing which causes the “Tragedy of the Commons” [8-10].</p>
      <p>Aiming at solving the above tragedy and investigating the reason why cooperators can survive in reality, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as reward [11], punishment [12-15], reputation [12, 16], volunteering [9, 17, 18], social diversity [19] and so on. Besides, the enhancement factor evolving with time is identified as a useful mechanism for evolution of cooperative behavior in PGG [20]. Recently, the topology of the game has been intensively studied as a paradigm for illustrating how cooperative behavior evolves in spatial PGG [21, 22], such as scale free networks [23-25], interdependent networks [26, 27], and they have proved valuable for solving the tragedy to some extent. To summarize, in all the works above it is assumed that the investments of all the cooperators are identical, often equal to 1. However, it is worth mentioning that in the rapidly developing modern society, players are diverse and they often treat the same problem differently [28-30].</p>
      <p>In the present work, the diversity of players is taken into consideration. With the aim of modeling the heterogeneous players in spatial PGG without loss of generality, it is assumed that the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution�, the mean value of which is equal to 1. Moreover, we will discuss the impact of � on evolution of cooperative behavior. In order to explore how the heterogeneous investment affects the evolution of cooperative behavior, we compare the traditional update rule with the coevolution of strategy and investment, and by statistical analysis we further reveal that heterogeneous investment can promote cooperation in spatial PGG.</p>

      <div class="teidiv2" id="methods">
      <h4><span class="head">Methods</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">In this article, the public goods game is considered on a two dimensional square lattice of size � with periodic boundary conditions. At the first step, each player can choose a pure strategy cooperation or defection randomly. Suppose that cooperator � contributes � to the public goods while defectors contribute nothing, here � is a random variable, and�. It is apparent that the mean of � is 1 without loss of generality. Practically, when�, the model is identical with the traditional PGG. Suppose that the contribution of � is independent of that of other players.</p>
      <p>For the sake of accelerating the simulations but without causing major modifications in the system’s dynamics, it is assumed that the score of player � is determined by a single PGG which involves the focal player and its four nearest neighbors [9]. The sum of all contributions in the group is multiplied by the factor �, and the resulting public goods are distributed among all the group members. Correspondingly, the payoff of player � is</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the strategy of player �, � denotes the group size, and in this article �.</p>
      <p>The Monte Carlo (MC) simulations start from a random initial strategy distribution, and the evolution procedure is subsequently controlled by a random sequential strategy update. In detail, player � and one of its neighbors � are chosen randomly. Following the payoffs � calculated as described above, player � imitates the strategy of player � with a probability</p>
      <p>�</p>
      <p>where � denotes the cost of strategy change and � introduces some noise to allow for irrational decisions, and in this article � [9]. For the sake of comparison, the coevolution of strategy and investment, namely player � imitates also the investment of player � simultaneously, is considered. Furthermore, for the results presented in the next section, the square lattice used is sized �. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators is determined by averaging over 5000 generations after a transient time of 55000 MCS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="teidiv2" id="results">
      <h4><span class="head">Results</span></h4>
      <p class="First Paragraph">Firstly, it is instructive to examine the time series of the fraction of cooperators. Results presented in figure 1 are the time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The figure depicts that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution but increases to the value in the steady state later. The random distribution of the initial strategy gives rise to the decline of cooperation in the beginning, that is, the cooperators are dispersed and the defectors can invade the cooperators easily, which is corresponding to the initial phase in figure 1. As the evolution proceeds, the lived cooperators form clusters and the payoffs of them are enhanced, which restrain the invasion of the defectors. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous investments render the manifold payoff difference between cooperators and defectors, which in turn boosts the possibility for defectors to imitate cooperators.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1. Time series of the fraction of cooperators for different values of � when � equals to 5. The value of �is equal to 0.0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1.0 respectively. While �, which is exactly the traditional case, the investment of all the cooperators is 1. With the increment of �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators will increase.</p>
      <p>While figure 1 shows the time series of fraction of cooperators, the relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � when� is presented in figure 2. It is worth to note that, the black curve in figure 2 corresponding to � is in agreement with the results in reference [9]. The asymptotic fraction of cooperators � depending on the enhancement factor � reveals that � is enhanced with increasing of � for different values of �. Meanwhile, the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. Besides, a large value of � will guarantee that the cooperators will survive when the enhancement factor � is small. In addition, for each curve in figure 2, there exit two thresholds � and �. In other words, if � the phase of the population after behavioral evolution is pure defectors, and if � the phase of the population is pure cooperators, while in case of � the population consist of not only cooperators but also defectors. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that larger value of � can decrease the value of � and � effectively. Therefore, to sum up, when the investment of a cooperator is a random variable with uniform distribution �, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators can be promoted. Furthermore, the larger the value of � is, the better the promotion effect will be.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. Relationship between asymptotic fraction of cooperators � and enhancement factor � corresponding to �respectively. The curves in the figure show that the larger the value of � is, the bigger the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � will be. In addition, larger value of � can decrease the values of � and � effectively.</p>
      <p>In order to depict the evolutionary process vividly, the typical snapshots are represented in figure 3 when � and �. From the figure it can be clearly concluded that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3. Typical snapshots of strategy distributions on the square lattice when � and �. Cooperators and defectors are colored red and blue, and the MCS of (a)-(d) is 1, 10, 100, 50000 respectively. The figure shows that the fraction of cooperators decreases at the beginning of the evolution, but as the evolution proceeds, the cooperators form into clusters to restrain the invasion of the defectors, and spread to the defectors reversely. At the end of the evolution all the players in the population hold the cooperation strategy.</p>
      <p>Next, the relationship between fraction of cooperators and enhancement factor when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into consideration will be discussed. The curves in figure 4 show that if �, the thresholds � and � become smaller compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted through the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>

The curves show that if �, the thresholds � and � decrease compared to the case of �, which is exactly the traditional situation. This implies that cooperation can be promoted by introducing the coevolution of strategy and investment.</p>
      <p>Comparing the curves in figures 2 and 4 leads to the interesting conclusion that the promotion effect of coevolution of strategy and investment is inferior to that of strategy imitation only. With the aim to explore the difference between them, we will discuss the investment distribution of cooperators in steady state. Figure 5 shows the investment distribution in case of coevolution of strategy and investment (Right panel) and the distribution in case of strategy imitation only (Left panel), and the parameters in the two situations are equal, namely �，�. When only strategy is updated, the distribution of the investment in steady state is still a uniform distribution�. However, when the coevolution of strategy and investment is taken into account, the previous uniform distribution is severely distorted, and the steady investment satisfies a discrete distribution valued �. Therefore, the heterogeneity of investment is weakened in this case. Consequently, the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � decreases. In the same way, through statistical analysis it can be concluded that for the same enhancement �, the smaller the value of � is, the more severe the distortion from previous uniform distribution will be. This implies that the coevolution of strategy and investment decreases the asymptotic fraction of cooperators � by weakening the heterogeneity of investment once again.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span></p>
      <p>African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p>
      <p>There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana</span> (Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p>
      <p>African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p>
      <p>The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p>
      <p>The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p>
      <p>The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span></p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span></p>
      <p>The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p>
      <p>For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p>
      <p>The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span></p>
      <p>The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span></p>
      <p>We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p>
      <p>In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989 [41].</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span></p>
      <p>Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012 [52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically. </p>
      <p>Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p>
      <p>Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/">http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/</a>). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65].</p>
      <p>Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years [47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen. This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</p>
      <p>Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession [67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </p>
      <p>In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Materials and Methods</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Ethics statement</span></p>
      <p>All research was conducted using observation of indirect signs of forest elephants (dung). </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Data collection and standardization</span></p>
      <p>We modelled temporal and spatial trends using data collected during 13,000 km of elephant-dung foot-surveys in 80 sites during 91,600 person-days from 2002 to 2011 (Fig. S3 shows temporal coverage). Field protocol followed the standardized 2003 methods of the <span class="headgreen">Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) [80] program of </span>the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent.</p>
      <p>All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </p>
      <p>Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </p>

      <p class="SOM Text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Statistical modelling</span>. We assessed known or suspected drivers of elephant density and distribution [16,17,30,33,54,55] using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [84] due to their flexibility and capacity for non-linear responses.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text">The standardized response variable was elephant dung pile counts within one metre of the centre line, adjusted for survey effort. GAMs were fit to elephant dung pile count data of the form:</p>

By including area surveyed as an offset term in the model, elephant dung density is in effect being modelled. A negative binomial distribution was used to deal appropriately with severe over-dispersion in the count data. The scale parameter theta of the negative binomial was treated as unknown and an interval of (1,3) over which to search for theta was specified. Thin plate regression splines were used to fit the smooth functions, where the ‘performance iteration’ method was used for smoothing parameter estimation. To avoid overfitting, given the limited number of data points (80 survey sites), the gamma parameter was set to a value of 1.4 for all models, which forced the model to be smoother than it might otherwise have been [84]. With the limited number of data points (80 sites across years) it was not possible to account for the nested nature of sites within countries by means of a hierarchical model structure; instead country was simply included as a factor variable. The models were fit in R [85] using the <span style="font-style:italic">mgcv</span> package.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text">Competing models, i.e. those with different covariates, were ranked by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) criterion [84]. The significance of explanatory variables (based on the P-values returned for each of the terms in the GAM), percent deviance explained by the model and model fit diagnostics (Normal Q-Q, residuals vs. linear predictor, histogram of residuals, response vs. fitted values) were also considered [84]. Model selection was based on the UBRE criterion [84].</p>
      <p>Models where survey year was modelled by country served to examine country-specific changes over the period 2002-2011. There were indications of country specific changes over time (Fig. S4 shows how the decline in DRC is potentially more extreme than in Gabon, for example). However, given the sparseness of the time series for Cameroon and in particular CAR and the lack of data points for Congo and DRC at the beginning of the period (Fig. S3), we did not incorporate country specific changes over time in the final models used to predict dung density across the Central African forests. Instead we restricted our predictions to models with the same smooth function for temporal change across the Central African forests. </p>
      <p>Given the similarity in UBRE scores for the top models, we estimated elephant dung density using each of them (Table S2). The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are also shown. The confidence limits are wide and the percent coefficients of variation were frequently larger than 100 (this was particularly the case for models including HII with the exception of models HII 3 and HII 5 in 2011). When models contained survey year (the proxy for temporal change), we estimated elephant dung density in both 2002 and in 2011, rather than just obtaining an average for the 2002-2011 period, which allowed us to calculate rates of decline and percent range loss from these models; estimates of the percentage of extremely low elephant density range overall and by country for 2002 and 2011 are also given (Table S3). </p>
      <p class="SOM Text">Variance and percentile confidence intervals of elephant abundance estimates were estimated using a combination of nonparametric and parametric bootstrapping [86]. A total of 999 bootstraps were conducted during which replicate survey sites, assumed to be independently and identically distributed, were resampled at random and with replacement until each bootstrap resample was the same size as the original number of 80 survey sites (nonparametric component). Dung abundance estimates were obtained from these resampled data conditioned on the original model fit. Dung abundance estimates were converted to elephant abundance by applying conversion factors (described below) with associated total variance obtained by incorporating the variance associated with the conversion factors. During each iteration of the bootstrap routine, conversion factor values were generated from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated value of the conversion factor and the variance equal to the squared value of the associated standard error (parametric component). Estimates of elephant numbers were ordered from smallest to largest and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 975<sup>th</sup> value was used to define the percentile confidence interval. The coefficient of variation was obtained by dividing the square root of the variance of the abundance estimates from the resampled data predictions by the mean of those abundance estimates.</p>
      <p>We defined extremely low density areas where dung density fell between 0-100 dung piles/ km<sup>2</sup> (in practice this approximates to &gt; 0.1 dung pile encountered per km walked) based on knowledge of areas within Central Africa which have extremely few or no elephants remaining (in part relying on design-based estimates of dung abundance). All of the areas where we already knew that there were extremely few or no elephants (from historical surveys, from some of these surveys included here, or from other surveys not included in this dataset), such as the majority of the southern Republic of Congo, and the majority of the forests in western Cameroon, fell into this density class, giving us confidence in the model’s ability to predict elephant range where there are almost no elephants left.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conversion factors.</span> Dung density estimates were converted to elephant numbers using estimated production and decay rates since actual rates are notoriously difficult to collect ([87]) and were not available at every site. A production rate of 19.77 dung piles/day (standard error (SE) = 0.23) [88], also suggested by the rainfall regime of much of the area [89], was used. The same rate was also used to assess historical forest elephant loss up to 1989 [41], ensuring comparative differences were not a function of this model assumption. To ensure that the decay rate used in the conversion was representative of our sites that ranged widely in space and time, we used the mean (81.82 days, SE = 6.68 days) of fourteen estimates of dung disappearance time for different seasons, habitats and sites. No particular geographical pattern for decay rate from west to east across the basin was evident in these studies, and the associated variance was low enough to make us more confident in our application of this as a standard conversion factor, whilst recognising that there is variation within decay rates associated with season, sunspots, and rainfall [90,91,92]. To convert dung to elephant density, only dung piles not in a late stage of decomposition (“class E” of [93] are generally included. For this dataset dung density was reduced by 32.1% (SE = 3.7%), the mean percent of dung piles classified as “E”, before estimating elephant density.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Explanatory variables</span>. Explanatory variables used in the GAM analysis were (Table S4) [94]: (i)<span style="font-style:italic"> site-level </span>at the scale of individual sampling units, (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">country-level </span>(including country itself), and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">regional proxies</span> latitude and longitude to capture possible geographical gradients in density not captured by other variables. Variables were either recorded at each survey site (hunter-sign frequency, survey year, presence/absence of guards), retrieved from reports (official protection reflecting the degree of potential protection) and online databases (Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index [45], or from GIS data layers (distance-based for poacher access, i.e., proximity to major roads; pressure-based for poacher numbers, i.e., human population density [95], the Human Influence Index [44]. Square root transformations for hunter-sign frequency and human population density were considered due to possible undue leverage from the few high values. The predicted likely influence on elephant density for each of the explanatory variable is given (Table S4). Assumptions implicit in the choice of these variables were based on previous work [16,17,33,54,55]. We assumed that both direct hunting pressure (as measured by encounter rate of hunter sign) and measures of human population density and activity (as measured by distance to the nearest road, human population density, and the human influence index) results in elephants moving away from human-dominated areas and/or being killed by poachers. We assumed that official protection of a site (such as National Park status) would reflect real protection, in other words that elephants would be more likely to be at higher densities in such sites. We assumed that if guards were present at a site, that they were actually effective in deterring poaching. We assumed that our measure of governance (CPI) reflected the suite of social, economic, and development factors associated with each country; governance and development had previously been shown to be associated with elephant poaching by the two MIKE analyses in 2009 and 2012 [16,33].</p>
      <p>Pearson's product-moment correlation tests (two-sided) with null hypothesis that true correlation is equal to zero were conducted for each pair-wise combination of explanatory variables considered. Variables were considered significantly correlated at the 5% level. Correlations between variables were taken into account to avoid the inclusion of highly correlated variables in the same model. Model prediction was limited to Central African forested regions, including swamp forest [96], in the five countries with survey sites. GIS grids were created at a resolution of approximately 1x1 km<sup>2</sup>, and prediction was carried out at the same resolution.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Reporting results.</span> Generally, averaged estimates from the set of top-ranking predictive models were given. Potential elephant range was defined by forest cover. Elephant range and high density elephant areas were estimated as the aggregate of areas with &gt;100 and &gt;1,000 elephant dung piles/km<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span></p>
      <p>African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</p>
      <p>There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana</span> (Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</p>
      <p>African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </p>
      <p>The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</p>
      <p>The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent. In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</p>
      <p>The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span></p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate a widespread and catastrophic decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span></p>
      <p>The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: [44]), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</p>
      <p>For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </p>
      <p>The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span></p>
      <p>The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span></p>
      <p>We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</p>
      <p>In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989 [41].</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span></p>
      <p>Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012 [52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically. </p>
      <p>Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</p>
      <p>Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website <a class="link_ref" href="http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/">http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/</a>). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65].</p>
      <p>Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years [47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen. This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</p>
      <p>Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession [67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </p>
      <p>In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive.</p>

      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Ethics statement</span></p>
      <p>All research was conducted using observation of indirect signs of forest elephants (dung). </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Data collection and standardization</span></p>
      <p>We modelled temporal and spatial trends using data collected during 13,000 km of elephant-dung foot-surveys in 80 sites during 91,600 person-days from 2002 to 2011 (Fig. S3 shows temporal coverage). Field protocol followed the standardized 2003 methods of the <span class="headgreen">Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) [80] program of </span>the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent.</p>
      <p>All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </p>
      <p>Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic">Data Analysis</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Statistical modelling</span>. We assessed known or suspected drivers of elephant density and distribution [16,17,30,33,54,55] using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [84] due to their flexibility and capacity for non-linear responses.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text">The standardized response variable was elephant dung pile counts within one metre of the centre line, adjusted for survey effort. GAMs were fit to elephant dung pile count data of the form:</p>

By including area surveyed as an offset term in the model, elephant dung density is in effect being modelled. A negative binomial distribution was used to deal appropriately with severe over-dispersion in the count data. The scale parameter theta of the negative binomial was treated as unknown and an interval of (1,3) over which to search for theta was specified. Thin plate regression splines were used to fit the smooth functions, where the ‘performance iteration’ method was used for smoothing parameter estimation. To avoid overfitting, given the limited number of data points (80 survey sites), the gamma parameter was set to a value of 1.4 for all models, which forced the model to be smoother than it might otherwise have been [84]. With the limited number of data points (80 sites across years) it was not possible to account for the nested nature of sites within countries by means of a hierarchical model structure; instead country was simply included as a factor variable. The models were fit in R [85] using the <span style="font-style:italic">mgcv</span> package.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text">Competing models, i.e. those with different covariates, were ranked by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) criterion [84]. The significance of explanatory variables (based on the P-values returned for each of the terms in the GAM), percent deviance explained by the model and model fit diagnostics (Normal Q-Q, residuals vs. linear predictor, histogram of residuals, response vs. fitted values) were also considered [84]. Model selection was based on the UBRE criterion [84].</p>
      <p>Models where survey year was modelled by country served to examine country-specific changes over the period 2002-2011. There were indications of country specific changes over time (Fig. S4 shows how the decline in DRC is potentially more extreme than in Gabon, for example). However, given the sparseness of the time series for Cameroon and in particular CAR and the lack of data points for Congo and DRC at the beginning of the period (Fig. S3), we did not incorporate country specific changes over time in the final models used to predict dung density across the Central African forests. Instead we restricted our predictions to models with the same smooth function for temporal change across the Central African forests. </p>
      <p>Given the similarity in UBRE scores for the top models, we estimated elephant dung density using each of them (Table S2). The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are also shown. The confidence limits are wide and the percent coefficients of variation were frequently larger than 100 (this was particularly the case for models including HII with the exception of models HII 3 and HII 5 in 2011). When models contained survey year (the proxy for temporal change), we estimated elephant dung density in both 2002 and in 2011, rather than just obtaining an average for the 2002-2011 period, which allowed us to calculate rates of decline and percent range loss from these models; estimates of the percentage of extremely low elephant density range overall and by country for 2002 and 2011 are also given (Table S3). </p>
      <p class="SOM Text">Variance and percentile confidence intervals of elephant abundance estimates were estimated using a combination of nonparametric and parametric bootstrapping [86]. A total of 999 bootstraps were conducted during which replicate survey sites, assumed to be independently and identically distributed, were resampled at random and with replacement until each bootstrap resample was the same size as the original number of 80 survey sites (nonparametric component). Dung abundance estimates were obtained from these resampled data conditioned on the original model fit. Dung abundance estimates were converted to elephant abundance by applying conversion factors (described below) with associated total variance obtained by incorporating the variance associated with the conversion factors. During each iteration of the bootstrap routine, conversion factor values were generated from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated value of the conversion factor and the variance equal to the squared value of the associated standard error (parametric component). Estimates of elephant numbers were ordered from smallest to largest and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 975<sup>th</sup> value was used to define the percentile confidence interval. The coefficient of variation was obtained by dividing the square root of the variance of the abundance estimates from the resampled data predictions by the mean of those abundance estimates.</p>
      <p>We defined extremely low density areas where dung density fell between 0-100 dung piles/ km<sup>2</sup> (in practice this approximates to &gt; 0.1 dung pile encountered per km walked) based on knowledge of areas within Central Africa which have extremely few or no elephants remaining (in part relying on design-based estimates of dung abundance). All of the areas where we already knew that there were extremely few or no elephants (from historical surveys, from some of these surveys included here, or from other surveys not included in this dataset), such as the majority of the southern Republic of Congo, and the majority of the forests in western Cameroon, fell into this density class, giving us confidence in the model’s ability to predict elephant range where there are almost no elephants left.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conversion factors.</span> Dung density estimates were converted to elephant numbers using estimated production and decay rates since actual rates are notoriously difficult to collect ([87]) and were not available at every site. A production rate of 19.77 dung piles/day (standard error (SE) = 0.23) [88], also suggested by the rainfall regime of much of the area [89], was used. The same rate was also used to assess historical forest elephant loss up to 1989 [41], ensuring comparative differences were not a function of this model assumption. To ensure that the decay rate used in the conversion was representative of our sites that ranged widely in space and time, we used the mean (81.82 days, SE = 6.68 days) of fourteen estimates of dung disappearance time for different seasons, habitats and sites. No particular geographical pattern for decay rate from west to east across the basin was evident in these studies, and the associated variance was low enough to make us more confident in our application of this as a standard conversion factor, whilst recognising that there is variation within decay rates associated with season, sunspots, and rainfall [90,91,92]. To convert dung to elephant density, only dung piles not in a late stage of decomposition (“class E” of [93] are generally included. For this dataset dung density was reduced by 32.1% (SE = 3.7%), the mean percent of dung piles classified as “E”, before estimating elephant density.</p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Explanatory variables</span>. Explanatory variables used in the GAM analysis were (Table S4) [94]: (i)<span style="font-style:italic"> site-level </span>at the scale of individual sampling units, (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">country-level </span>(including country itself), and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">regional proxies</span> latitude and longitude to capture possible geographical gradients in density not captured by other variables. Variables were either recorded at each survey site (hunter-sign frequency, survey year, presence/absence of guards), retrieved from reports (official protection reflecting the degree of potential protection) and online databases (Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index [45], or from GIS data layers (distance-based for poacher access, i.e., proximity to major roads; pressure-based for poacher numbers, i.e., human population density [95], the Human Influence Index [44]. Square root transformations for hunter-sign frequency and human population density were considered due to possible undue leverage from the few high values. The predicted likely influence on elephant density for each of the explanatory variable is given (Table S4). Assumptions implicit in the choice of these variables were based on previous work [16,17,33,54,55]. We assumed that both direct hunting pressure (as measured by encounter rate of hunter sign) and measures of human population density and activity (as measured by distance to the nearest road, human population density, and the human influence index) results in elephants moving away from human-dominated areas and/or being killed by poachers. We assumed that official protection of a site (such as National Park status) would reflect real protection, in other words that elephants would be more likely to be at higher densities in such sites. We assumed that if guards were present at a site, that they were actually effective in deterring poaching. We assumed that our measure of governance (CPI) reflected the suite of social, economic, and development factors associated with each country; governance and development had previously been shown to be associated with elephant poaching by the two MIKE analyses in 2009 and 2012 [16,33].</p>
      <p>Pearson's product-moment correlation tests (two-sided) with null hypothesis that true correlation is equal to zero were conducted for each pair-wise combination of explanatory variables considered. Variables were considered significantly correlated at the 5% level. Correlations between variables were taken into account to avoid the inclusion of highly correlated variables in the same model. Model prediction was limited to Central African forested regions, including swamp forest [96], in the five countries with survey sites. GIS grids were created at a resolution of approximately 1x1 km<sup>2</sup>, and prediction was carried out at the same resolution.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Reporting results.</span> Generally, averaged estimates from the set of top-ranking predictive models were given. Potential elephant range was defined by forest cover. Elephant range and high density elephant areas were estimated as the aggregate of areas with &gt;100 and &gt;1,000 elephant dung piles/km<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent.  The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our results demonstrate a widespread decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: </span>[44]<span class="page_number">), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989 [41].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012 [52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website </span><a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="page_number">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years [47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen. This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession [67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We modelled temporal and spatial trends using data collected during 13,000 km of elephant-dung foot-surveys in 80 sites during 91,600 person-days from 2002 to 2011 (Fig. S3 shows temporal coverage). Field protocol followed the standardized 2003 methods of the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) [80] program of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span></p>

      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">The standardized response variable was elephant dung pile counts within one metre of the centre line, adjusted for survey effort. GAMs were fit to elephant dung pile count data of the form:</span></p>

By including area surveyed as an offset term in the model, elephant dung density is in effect being modelled. A negative binomial distribution was used to deal appropriately with severe over-dispersion in the count data. The scale parameter theta of the negative binomial was treated as unknown and an interval of (1,3) over which to search for theta was specified. Thin plate regression splines were used to fit the smooth functions, where the ‘performance iteration’ method was used for smoothing parameter estimation. To avoid overfitting, given the limited number of data points (80 survey sites), the gamma parameter was set to a value of 1.4 for all models, which forced the model to be smoother than it might otherwise have been [84]. With the limited number of data points (80 sites across years) it was not possible to account for the nested nature of sites within countries by means of a hierarchical model structure; instead country was simply included as a factor variable. The models were fit in R [85] using the <span style="font-style:italic">mgcv</span> package. </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Competing models, i.e. those with different covariates, were ranked by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) criterion [84]. The significance of explanatory variables (based on the P-values returned for each of the terms in the GAM), percent deviance explained by the model and model fit diagnostics (Normal Q-Q, residuals vs. linear predictor, histogram of residuals, response vs. fitted values) were also considered [84]. Model selection was based on the UBRE criterion [84].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Models where survey year was modelled by country served to examine country-specific changes over the period 2002-2011. There were indications of country specific changes over time (Fig. S4 shows how the decline in DRC is potentially more extreme than in Gabon, for example). However, given the sparseness of the time series for Cameroon and in particular CAR and the lack of data points for Congo and DRC at the beginning of the period (Fig. S3), we did not incorporate country specific changes over time in the final models used to predict dung density across the Central African forests. Instead we restricted our predictions to models with the same smooth function for temporal change across the Central African forests. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Given the similarity in UBRE scores for the top models, we estimated elephant dung density using each of them (Table S2). The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are also shown. The confidence limits are wide and the percent coefficients of variation were frequently larger than 100 (this was particularly the case for models including HII with the exception of models HII 3 and HII 5 in 2011). When models contained survey year (the proxy for temporal change), we estimated elephant dung density in both 2002 and in 2011, rather than just obtaining an average for the 2002-2011 period, which allowed us to calculate rates of decline and percent range loss from these models; estimates of the percentage of extremely low elephant density range overall and by country for 2002 and 2011 are also given (Table S3). </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Variance and percentile confidence intervals of elephant abundance estimates were estimated using a combination of nonparametric and parametric bootstrapping [86]. A total of 999 bootstraps were conducted during which replicate survey sites, assumed to be independently and identically distributed, were resampled at random and with replacement until each bootstrap resample was the same size as the original number of 80 survey sites (nonparametric component). Dung abundance estimates were obtained from these resampled data conditioned on the original model fit. Dung abundance estimates were converted to elephant abundance by applying conversion factors (described below) with associated total variance obtained by incorporating the variance associated with the conversion factors. During each iteration of the bootstrap routine, conversion factor values were generated from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated value of the conversion factor and the variance equal to the squared value of the associated standard error (parametric component). Estimates of elephant numbers were ordered from smallest to largest and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 975<sup>th</sup> value was used to define the percentile confidence interval. The coefficient of variation was obtained by dividing the square root of the variance of the abundance estimates from the resampled data predictions by the mean of those abundance estimates. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We defined extremely low density areas where dung density fell between 0-100 dung piles/ km<sup>2</sup> (in practice this approximates to &gt; 0.1 dung pile encountered per km walked) based on knowledge of areas within Central Africa which have extremely few or no elephants remaining (in part relying on design-based estimates of dung abundance). All of the areas where we already knew that there were extremely few or no elephants (from historical surveys, from some of these surveys included here, or from other surveys not included in this dataset), such as the majority of the southern Republic of Congo, and the majority of the forests in western Cameroon, fell into this density class, giving us confidence in the model’s ability to predict elephant range where there are almost no elephants left.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conversion factors.</span> Dung density estimates were converted to elephant numbers using estimated production and decay rates since actual rates are notoriously difficult to collect ([87]) and were not available at every site. A production rate of 19.77 dung piles/day (standard error (SE) = 0.23) [88], also suggested by the rainfall regime of much of the area [89], was used. The same rate was also used to assess historical forest elephant loss up to 1989 [41], ensuring comparative differences were not a function of this model assumption. To ensure that the decay rate used in the conversion was representative of our sites that ranged widely in space and time, we used the mean (81.82 days, SE = 6.68 days) of fourteen estimates of dung disappearance time for different seasons, habitats and sites. No particular geographical pattern for decay rate from west to east across the basin was evident in these studies, and the associated variance was low enough to make us more confident in our application of this as a standard conversion factor, whilst recognising that there is variation within decay rates associated with season, sunspots, and rainfall [90,91,92]. To convert dung to elephant density, only dung piles not in a late stage of decomposition (“class E” of [93] are generally included. For this dataset dung density was reduced by 32.1% (SE = 3.7%), the mean percent of dung piles classified as “E”, before estimating elephant density.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Explanatory variables</span>. Explanatory variables used in the GAM analysis were (Table S4) [94]: (i)<span style="font-style:italic"> site-level </span>at the scale of individual sampling units, (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">country-level </span>(including country itself), and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">regional proxies</span> latitude and longitude to capture possible geographical gradients in density not captured by other variables. Variables were either recorded at each survey site (hunter-sign frequency, survey year, presence/absence of guards), retrieved from reports (official protection reflecting the degree of potential protection) and online databases (Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index [45], or from GIS data layers (distance-based for poacher access, i.e., proximity to major roads; pressure-based for poacher numbers, i.e., human population density [95], the Human Influence Index [44]. Square root transformations for hunter-sign frequency and human population density were considered due to possible undue leverage from the few high values. The predicted likely influence on elephant density for each of the explanatory variable is given (Table S4). Assumptions implicit in the choice of these variables were based on previous work [16,17,33,54,55]. We assumed that both direct hunting pressure (as measured by encounter rate of hunter sign) and measures of human population density and activity (as measured by distance to the nearest road, human population density, and the human influence index) results in elephants moving away from human-dominated areas and/or being killed by poachers. We assumed that official protection of a site (such as National Park status) would reflect real protection, in other words that elephants would be more likely to be at higher densities in such sites. We assumed that if guards were present at a site, that they were actually effective in deterring poaching. We assumed that our measure of governance (CPI) reflected the suite of social, economic, and development factors associated with each country; governance and development had previously been shown to be associated with elephant poaching by the two MIKE analyses in 2009 and 2012 [16,33].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Pearson's product-moment correlation tests (two-sided) with null hypothesis that true correlation is equal to zero were conducted for each pair-wise combination of explanatory variables considered. Variables were considered significantly correlated at the 5% level. Correlations between variables were taken into account to avoid the inclusion of highly correlated variables in the same model. Model prediction was limited to Central African forested regions, including swamp forest [96], in the five countries with survey sites. GIS grids were created at a resolution of approximately 1x1 km<sup>2</sup>, and prediction was carried out at the same resolution. </span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent.  The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our results demonstrate a widespread decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: </span>[44]<span class="page_number">), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989 [41].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012 [52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website </span><a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="page_number">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years [47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen. This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession [67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We modelled temporal and spatial trends using data collected during 13,000 km of elephant-dung foot-surveys in 80 sites during 91,600 person-days from 2002 to 2011 (Fig. S3 shows temporal coverage). Field protocol followed the standardized 2003 methods of the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) [80] program of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span></p>

      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Statistical modelling</span>. We assessed known or suspected drivers of elephant density and distribution [16,17,30,33,54,55] using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [84] due to their flexibility and capacity for non-linear responses.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">The standardized response variable was elephant dung pile counts within one metre of the centre line, adjusted for survey effort. GAMs were fit to elephant dung pile count data of the form:</span></p>

By including area surveyed as an offset term in the model, elephant dung density is in effect being modelled. A negative binomial distribution was used to deal appropriately with severe over-dispersion in the count data. The scale parameter theta of the negative binomial was treated as unknown and an interval of (1,3) over which to search for theta was specified. Thin plate regression splines were used to fit the smooth functions, where the ‘performance iteration’ method was used for smoothing parameter estimation. To avoid overfitting, given the limited number of data points (80 survey sites), the gamma parameter was set to a value of 1.4 for all models, which forced the model to be smoother than it might otherwise have been [84]. With the limited number of data points (80 sites across years) it was not possible to account for the nested nature of sites within countries by means of a hierarchical model structure; instead country was simply included as a factor variable. The models were fit in R [85] using the <span style="font-style:italic">mgcv</span> package. </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Competing models, i.e. those with different covariates, were ranked by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) criterion [84]. The significance of explanatory variables (based on the P-values returned for each of the terms in the GAM), percent deviance explained by the model and model fit diagnostics (Normal Q-Q, residuals vs. linear predictor, histogram of residuals, response vs. fitted values) were also considered [84]. Model selection was based on the UBRE criterion [84].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Models where survey year was modelled by country served to examine country-specific changes over the period 2002-2011. There were indications of country specific changes over time (Fig. S4 shows how the decline in DRC is potentially more extreme than in Gabon, for example). However, given the sparseness of the time series for Cameroon and in particular CAR and the lack of data points for Congo and DRC at the beginning of the period (Fig. S3), we did not incorporate country specific changes over time in the final models used to predict dung density across the Central African forests. Instead we restricted our predictions to models with the same smooth function for temporal change across the Central African forests. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Given the similarity in UBRE scores for the top models, we estimated elephant dung density using each of them (Table S2). The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are also shown. The confidence limits are wide and the percent coefficients of variation were frequently larger than 100 (this was particularly the case for models including HII with the exception of models HII 3 and HII 5 in 2011). When models contained survey year (the proxy for temporal change), we estimated elephant dung density in both 2002 and in 2011, rather than just obtaining an average for the 2002-2011 period, which allowed us to calculate rates of decline and percent range loss from these models; estimates of the percentage of extremely low elephant density range overall and by country for 2002 and 2011 are also given (Table S3). </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Variance and percentile confidence intervals of elephant abundance estimates were estimated using a combination of nonparametric and parametric bootstrapping [86]. A total of 999 bootstraps were conducted during which replicate survey sites, assumed to be independently and identically distributed, were resampled at random and with replacement until each bootstrap resample was the same size as the original number of 80 survey sites (nonparametric component). Dung abundance estimates were obtained from these resampled data conditioned on the original model fit. Dung abundance estimates were converted to elephant abundance by applying conversion factors (described below) with associated total variance obtained by incorporating the variance associated with the conversion factors. During each iteration of the bootstrap routine, conversion factor values were generated from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated value of the conversion factor and the variance equal to the squared value of the associated standard error (parametric component). Estimates of elephant numbers were ordered from smallest to largest and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 975<sup>th</sup> value was used to define the percentile confidence interval. The coefficient of variation was obtained by dividing the square root of the variance of the abundance estimates from the resampled data predictions by the mean of those abundance estimates. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We defined extremely low density areas where dung density fell between 0-100 dung piles/ km<sup>2</sup> (in practice this approximates to &gt; 0.1 dung pile encountered per km walked) based on knowledge of areas within Central Africa which have extremely few or no elephants remaining (in part relying on design-based estimates of dung abundance). All of the areas where we already knew that there were extremely few or no elephants (from historical surveys, from some of these surveys included here, or from other surveys not included in this dataset), such as the majority of the southern Republic of Congo, and the majority of the forests in western Cameroon, fell into this density class, giving us confidence in the model’s ability to predict elephant range where there are almost no elephants left.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conversion factors.</span> Dung density estimates were converted to elephant numbers using estimated production and decay rates since actual rates are notoriously difficult to collect ([87]) and were not available at every site. A production rate of 19.77 dung piles/day (standard error (SE) = 0.23) [88], also suggested by the rainfall regime of much of the area [89], was used. The same rate was also used to assess historical forest elephant loss up to 1989 [41], ensuring comparative differences were not a function of this model assumption. To ensure that the decay rate used in the conversion was representative of our sites that ranged widely in space and time, we used the mean (81.82 days, SE = 6.68 days) of fourteen estimates of dung disappearance time for different seasons, habitats and sites. No particular geographical pattern for decay rate from west to east across the basin was evident in these studies, and the associated variance was low enough to make us more confident in our application of this as a standard conversion factor, whilst recognising that there is variation within decay rates associated with season, sunspots, and rainfall [90,91,92]. To convert dung to elephant density, only dung piles not in a late stage of decomposition (“class E” of [93] are generally included. For this dataset dung density was reduced by 32.1% (SE = 3.7%), the mean percent of dung piles classified as “E”, before estimating elephant density.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Explanatory variables</span>. Explanatory variables used in the GAM analysis were (Table S4) [94]: (i)<span style="font-style:italic"> site-level </span>at the scale of individual sampling units, (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">country-level </span>(including country itself), and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">regional proxies</span> latitude and longitude to capture possible geographical gradients in density not captured by other variables. Variables were either recorded at each survey site (hunter-sign frequency, survey year, presence/absence of guards), retrieved from reports (official protection reflecting the degree of potential protection) and online databases (Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index [45], or from GIS data layers (distance-based for poacher access, i.e., proximity to major roads; pressure-based for poacher numbers, i.e., human population density [95], the Human Influence Index [44]. Square root transformations for hunter-sign frequency and human population density were considered due to possible undue leverage from the few high values. The predicted likely influence on elephant density for each of the explanatory variable is given (Table S4). Assumptions implicit in the choice of these variables were based on previous work [16,17,33,54,55]. We assumed that both direct hunting pressure (as measured by encounter rate of hunter sign) and measures of human population density and activity (as measured by distance to the nearest road, human population density, and the human influence index) results in elephants moving away from human-dominated areas and/or being killed by poachers. We assumed that official protection of a site (such as National Park status) would reflect real protection, in other words that elephants would be more likely to be at higher densities in such sites. We assumed that if guards were present at a site, that they were actually effective in deterring poaching. We assumed that our measure of governance (CPI) reflected the suite of social, economic, and development factors associated with each country; governance and development had previously been shown to be associated with elephant poaching by the two MIKE analyses in 2009 and 2012 [16,33].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Pearson's product-moment correlation tests (two-sided) with null hypothesis that true correlation is equal to zero were conducted for each pair-wise combination of explanatory variables considered. Variables were considered significantly correlated at the 5% level. Correlations between variables were taken into account to avoid the inclusion of highly correlated variables in the same model. Model prediction was limited to Central African forested regions, including swamp forest [96], in the five countries with survey sites. GIS grids were created at a resolution of approximately 1x1 km<sup>2</sup>, and prediction was carried out at the same resolution. </span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent.  The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our results demonstrate a widespread decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: </span>[44]<span class="page_number">), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989 [41].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012 [52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website </span><a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="page_number">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years [47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen. This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession [67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We modelled temporal and spatial trends using data collected during 13,000 km of elephant-dung foot-surveys in 80 sites during 91,600 person-days from 2002 to 2011 (Fig. S3 shows temporal coverage). Field protocol followed the standardized 2003 methods of the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) [80] program of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span></p>

      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Statistical modelling</span>. We assessed known or suspected drivers of elephant density and distribution [16,17,30,33,54,55] using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [84] due to their flexibility and capacity for non-linear responses.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">The standardized response variable was elephant dung pile counts within one metre of the centre line, adjusted for survey effort. GAMs were fit to elephant dung pile count data of the form:</span></p>

By including area surveyed as an offset term in the model, elephant dung density is in effect being modelled. A negative binomial distribution was used to deal appropriately with severe over-dispersion in the count data. The scale parameter theta of the negative binomial was treated as unknown and an interval of (1,3) over which to search for theta was specified. Thin plate regression splines were used to fit the smooth functions, where the ‘performance iteration’ method was used for smoothing parameter estimation. To avoid overfitting, given the limited number of data points (80 survey sites), the gamma parameter was set to a value of 1.4 for all models, which forced the model to be smoother than it might otherwise have been [84]. With the limited number of data points (80 sites across years) it was not possible to account for the nested nature of sites within countries by means of a hierarchical model structure; instead country was simply included as a factor variable. The models were fit in R [85] using the <span style="font-style:italic">mgcv</span> package. </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Competing models, i.e. those with different covariates, were ranked by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) criterion [84]. The significance of explanatory variables (based on the P-values returned for each of the terms in the GAM), percent deviance explained by the model and model fit diagnostics (Normal Q-Q, residuals vs. linear predictor, histogram of residuals, response vs. fitted values) were also considered [84]. Model selection was based on the UBRE criterion [84].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Models where survey year was modelled by country served to examine country-specific changes over the period 2002-2011. There were indications of country specific changes over time (Fig. S4 shows how the decline in DRC is potentially more extreme than in Gabon, for example). However, given the sparseness of the time series for Cameroon and in particular CAR and the lack of data points for Congo and DRC at the beginning of the period (Fig. S3), we did not incorporate country specific changes over time in the final models used to predict dung density across the Central African forests. Instead we restricted our predictions to models with the same smooth function for temporal change across the Central African forests. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Given the similarity in UBRE scores for the top models, we estimated elephant dung density using each of them (Table S2). The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are also shown. The confidence limits are wide and the percent coefficients of variation were frequently larger than 100 (this was particularly the case for models including HII with the exception of models HII 3 and HII 5 in 2011). When models contained survey year (the proxy for temporal change), we estimated elephant dung density in both 2002 and in 2011, rather than just obtaining an average for the 2002-2011 period, which allowed us to calculate rates of decline and percent range loss from these models; estimates of the percentage of extremely low elephant density range overall and by country for 2002 and 2011 are also given (Table S3). </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Variance and percentile confidence intervals of elephant abundance estimates were estimated using a combination of nonparametric and parametric bootstrapping [86]. A total of 999 bootstraps were conducted during which replicate survey sites, assumed to be independently and identically distributed, were resampled at random and with replacement until each bootstrap resample was the same size as the original number of 80 survey sites (nonparametric component). Dung abundance estimates were obtained from these resampled data conditioned on the original model fit. Dung abundance estimates were converted to elephant abundance by applying conversion factors (described below) with associated total variance obtained by incorporating the variance associated with the conversion factors. During each iteration of the bootstrap routine, conversion factor values were generated from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated value of the conversion factor and the variance equal to the squared value of the associated standard error (parametric component). Estimates of elephant numbers were ordered from smallest to largest and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 975<sup>th</sup> value was used to define the percentile confidence interval. The coefficient of variation was obtained by dividing the square root of the variance of the abundance estimates from the resampled data predictions by the mean of those abundance estimates. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We defined extremely low density areas where dung density fell between 0-100 dung piles/ km<sup>2</sup> (in practice this approximates to &gt; 0.1 dung pile encountered per km walked) based on knowledge of areas within Central Africa which have extremely few or no elephants remaining (in part relying on design-based estimates of dung abundance). All of the areas where we already knew that there were extremely few or no elephants (from historical surveys, from some of these surveys included here, or from other surveys not included in this dataset), such as the majority of the southern Republic of Congo, and the majority of the forests in western Cameroon, fell into this density class, giving us confidence in the model’s ability to predict elephant range where there are almost no elephants left.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conversion factors.</span> Dung density estimates were converted to elephant numbers using estimated production and decay rates since actual rates are notoriously difficult to collect ([87]) and were not available at every site. A production rate of 19.77 dung piles/day (standard error (SE) = 0.23) [88], also suggested by the rainfall regime of much of the area [89], was used. The same rate was also used to assess historical forest elephant loss up to 1989 [41], ensuring comparative differences were not a function of this model assumption. To ensure that the decay rate used in the conversion was representative of our sites that ranged widely in space and time, we used the mean (81.82 days, SE = 6.68 days) of fourteen estimates of dung disappearance time for different seasons, habitats and sites. No particular geographical pattern for decay rate from west to east across the basin was evident in these studies, and the associated variance was low enough to make us more confident in our application of this as a standard conversion factor, whilst recognising that there is variation within decay rates associated with season, sunspots, and rainfall [90,91,92]. To convert dung to elephant density, only dung piles not in a late stage of decomposition (“class E” of [93] are generally included. For this dataset dung density was reduced by 32.1% (SE = 3.7%), the mean percent of dung piles classified as “E”, before estimating elephant density.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Explanatory variables</span>. Explanatory variables used in the GAM analysis were (Table S4) [94]: (i)<span style="font-style:italic"> site-level </span>at the scale of individual sampling units, (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">country-level </span>(including country itself), and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">regional proxies</span> latitude and longitude to capture possible geographical gradients in density not captured by other variables. Variables were either recorded at each survey site (hunter-sign frequency, survey year, presence/absence of guards), retrieved from reports (official protection reflecting the degree of potential protection) and online databases (Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index [45], or from GIS data layers (distance-based for poacher access, i.e., proximity to major roads; pressure-based for poacher numbers, i.e., human population density [95], the Human Influence Index [44]. Square root transformations for hunter-sign frequency and human population density were considered due to possible undue leverage from the few high values. The predicted likely influence on elephant density for each of the explanatory variable is given (Table S4). Assumptions implicit in the choice of these variables were based on previous work [16,17,33,54,55]. We assumed that both direct hunting pressure (as measured by encounter rate of hunter sign) and measures of human population density and activity (as measured by distance to the nearest road, human population density, and the human influence index) results in elephants moving away from human-dominated areas and/or being killed by poachers. We assumed that official protection of a site (such as National Park status) would reflect real protection, in other words that elephants would be more likely to be at higher densities in such sites. We assumed that if guards were present at a site, that they were actually effective in deterring poaching. We assumed that our measure of governance (CPI) reflected the suite of social, economic, and development factors associated with each country; governance and development had previously been shown to be associated with elephant poaching by the two MIKE analyses in 2009 and 2012 [16,33].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Pearson's product-moment correlation tests (two-sided) with null hypothesis that true correlation is equal to zero were conducted for each pair-wise combination of explanatory variables considered.

Model prediction was limited to Central African forested regions, including swamp forest [96], in the five countries with survey sites.

Also shown for the models that permit temporal prediction is the overall percent decline and overall percent range loss for the period 2002-2011 (elephants are assumed to be absent when dung density falls below 100 elephant dung piles/km<sup>2</sup>; see Table S3 and Fig. 2 for details, including a breakdown by country).</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Abstract</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants— taxonomically and functionally unique—are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002–2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The basic information required for effective conservation management of a species includes population status and distribution, identification and prioritization of threats, and trends in all of the above [1]. These metrics are the basis by which the IUCN Red List assesses the conservation status of species [2], and conservation policymakers and managers in the field decide on the management strategies which best serve the taxon in question. However, these requirements are notoriously difficult to ascertain and, therefore, lacking for numerous species including one of the world's largest terrestrial mammals, the African forest elephant.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">There are two distinct types of African elephants, often considered to be two species: savannah elephants<span style="font-style:italic"> Loxodonta africana </span>(Blumenbach, 1797) and forest elephants <span style="font-style:italic">L. cyclotis</span> (Matschie, 1900). In 2003, the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) listed them as subspecies <span style="font-style:italic">(L. a. cyclotis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">L. a. africana, </span>respectively), due to perceived data gaps [3]. However, in 2008 they suggested that further research may reveal more than one African elephant species [4]. It was proposed that they should be considered two species on morphological grounds [5] and are considered as such by the Convention on Migratory Species [6]. Genetic evidence also supports this view [7-15]. The AfESG do, however, stress that it is important to recognize the different challenges to the conservation of forest and savannah elephants [3,16].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">African forest elephants have deep ecological differences from savannah elephants. They are highly frugivorous [17-20] and thus play an important role in one of Earth’s primary carbon-sequestering forests [17,21,22]. They can move great quantities of large seeds many kilometres from the parent tree [17] and are thus integral for maintaining forest structure and diversity. They also maintain [23], and possibly create, forest clearings in mineral-rich soil, on which a wide variety of African forest fauna are dependent [24,25]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The history of African elephant abundance and distribution is strongly linked to the commerce in ivory, and their decline since the 1800s has been documented across the continent [26-28]. Even in the forests of Central Africa, a century ago, there were very few elephants remaining anywhere along the Gabonese coast, or around Brazzaville, in what is now the Republic of Congo [29]. It was thought that there was a slow decline in elephant populations during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, flattening off in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and then a steep drop between 1950 and 1989 [28]. Modern African elephant density, based on data up to 2007, has recently been shown to be correlated with human factors rather than ecological factors [30].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In the last few years there have been very large and frequent ivory seizures in Africa and Asia, and the combination of seizure data analysed by the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) and of elephant carcass data documented and analysed by the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme demonstrate that the illegal trade is escalating [16,32-36]. This increasing trade has been linked to increasing demand and value of ivory in China [37,38]. The proportion of elephant carcasses found that had been killed illegally in 2010 was the highest on record [39] only to be exceeded by 2011 levels [16,35]. Elephant meat is an important by-product, but ivory is the primary reason for elephant poaching [40]. It is now clear that elephants in general, and especially the elephants of Central Africa, are under serious threat [33] and that the poaching since 2011 , may be at the level at which all elephant populations are in net decline [16,31].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The elephant subpopulation of Central Africa (which included some savannah populations in Chad and northern Cameroon) was recognized in 2008 as Endangered by the IUCN [4]. In 2010, the African Elephant Action Plan [31] drawn up by all of the African elephant range states, ranked poaching and illegal trade in elephant products as the top threat to elephants across the continent.  The scale of historical forest elephant decline, although substantial [28,41], has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of comprehensive, range-wide information on distribution and density. Previous analyses, collected over a relatively short period and limited in geographic extent relative to their range, suggested a growing crisis for elephants in the Central African forests [42]. It is critical that a broader assessment is provided to understand range and demographic trends [16]. The Central African forest block covers about 95% of the current “known” and “possible” range of forest elephants [43]; the remaining 5% are in the forests of West Africa, to the west of the Cameroon-Nigeria border. We present the analysis of eighty surveys carried out over the nine-year period between 2002-2011 across the Central African forest block. The area stretches from the western Cameroon across to the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The analysis responds to recent demands for a rigorous, range-wide assessment of forest elephant conservation status [16,31]. Trends inferred from dung surveys are presented. In addition, landscape covariates correlated with dung density (a proxy for elephant density) were analyzed and results discussed with the aim of providing information to enhance effective conservation policy and management.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Results</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our results demonstrate a widespread decline in numbers of forest elephants, in the order of 62%, and a corresponding range contraction of approximately 30%, during the nine-year period 2002-2011 represented by this study (Figs 1 and 2, Tables S2 and S3). Forest elephants now have likely declined to extremely low density over 75% of their potential range (Tables S3, S6), and probably have been extirpated from large sections of this range. Considering 2002–2011 range contraction relative to elephant habitat per country, ca. 95% of DRC’s forests are likely to be almost empty of elephants, a country historically thought to have held the highest numbers (Table S3). About half of the surviving elephants are in Gabon, and under a fifth in DRC, despite these countries covering 13% and 62% of the total forest area, respectively (Table S6). In 2011, less than 2% of the Central African forest contained elephants at high density (Table S3). Even for Gabon, in 2011 high density populations were found in only 14% of the forest (a decline of over 18% between 2002 and 2011). No high density areas remained in DRC even in 2002. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in multi-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The overall top-ranked multi-variable model of elephant dung pile density by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) score included the explanatory variables: hunter-sign frequency, survey year, proximity to roads, human population density, corruption, and presence or absence of wildlife guards (Table S5 and Fig. 3). Site-specific dung-encounter rates and hunter-sign frequency were significantly negatively correlated—elephants occur where people do not—and both were strongly influenced by guard presence/absence (Figs 4-6). Survey year and corruption were included in almost all of the top-ranking models that included hunter sign. Models that included hunter-sign frequency were always better when considering UBRE score than otherwise identical models that excluded this variable and able to explain on average 50% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics (Table S5 and Fig. 3). The top-ranking models without the hunter sign covariate were similar to each other in terms of UBRE score and were able to explain on average 45% of the variability in the data with satisfactory model fit diagnostics with models including the HII (Human Influence Index: </span>[44]<span class="page_number">), in place of road proximity and human population density, generally a few percentage points lower; (Table S2 and Fig. S1). Again, survey year and corruption were included in almost all of these models. While hunter sign was clearly an important variable, it was one of the few for which data were collected directly during the surveys at each site (rather than extracting the information from GIS data layers, for example). Because it was site collected and not part of a global dataset such as the HII, it was not available at all locations across the Central African forests. Therefore, models containing hunter sign could not be used to produce predicted dung density surfaces and to estimate elephant range and abundance across the entire area of interest.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">For the set of top-ranked models that used the variables across Central Africa, dung density was significantly higher at sites with wildlife guards and with a designated official protection status (Fig. 4). Dung density was inversely correlated with corruption as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) [45]; with more widespread distributions and higher densities in less corrupt countries: Gabon was significantly higher and DRC significantly lower than the roughly similar Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR) and Republic of Congo (Congo) (Table S3). The regional proxy variables latitude and longitude appeared frequently among the top-ranking models and also captured significant variation. Longitude was the better covariate. In most of the models including either of these variables, these proxies indicated higher dung densities closer to the equator and significant decreases further east, which potentially represents site differences not accounted for by other variables, such as political instability in the Southeast (Eastern DRC) of the study area [46]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The inclusion of variables such as human population density, HII, and the presence/absence of wildlife guards always improved the UBRE score and were always statistically significant. Inclusion of variables such as proximity to roads, survey year and corruption in the models also improved the UBRE score, but these variables were occasionally non-significant. Either the HII or the combination of proximity to roads and human population density was used (with only human population density in some models), as the composite variable HII was highly correlated with the other two variables that comprise two of several variables used to generate the HII [44]. When considering the relative performance of the significantly correlated variables official protection and the presence/absence of guards (where official protection was low, there were no guards), the latter was much better in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained, and was thus the preferred variable in top-ranking models. Corruption, as measured by the CPI was very highly correlated and almost identical to the country factor in terms of improvements to the UBRE score and its effect on deviance explained; with the added benefit of providing insights on how corruption, conceptually associated with poaching, may be influencing elephant distribution and density by country. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Correlates of decline in single-variable models</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">The single variable modelling results were similar to the multi-variable models, where all variables considered were significantly related to elephant dung density (Fig. S2 and Table S4). Univariate models with the variables longitude, country, corruption, and survey year were highly ranked, whereas the model with official protection received the lowest ranking (the UBRE scores for the remaining variables are also shown in Table S4). Univariate models predicted that dung density decreased by (i) 89% as hunter-sign frequency increased from zero to four per km, (ii) 85% when guards were absent, (iii) 30% or 76% as proximity to road decreased from 50 to 25 or zero km, (iv) 48%, 75% or 92% as human density increased from one to five, 10 or 20 people/km<sup>2</sup>, and (v) 17% for each unit increase in the HII. Among the survey site specific variables, human population density had the highest value for deviance explained, followed by the hunter-sign frequency, the presence/absence of guards, and the HII. For the remaining site specific variables (official protection status, proximity to roads, and survey year) the values were considerably smaller. The highest deviance explained corresponded to country-level variables, such as country itself and corruption. The proxy variable longitude also had one of the largest values for deviance explained, whereas latitude did not (Table S4).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Predictive modelling of decline</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We used the top-ranking multi-variable models with available regional data to predict forest elephant dung density across Central Africa (Fig. 1 and Table S2). We chose to highlight two models including predictor variables that elephants might be responding to directly, rather than latitude and longitude, so as to avoid using spatial location as a proxy for other processes. These models also include survey year as a covariate, which allows for predictions by year and comparisons over time. Results were consistent across models, and predicted dung density across Central Africa reflected the map of actual dung encounter rate (Fig. 5) and also most of the “Known” range described by the African Elephant Database (AED) [47]. Broadly speaking, whether using the HII or a combination of road proximity and human population density, the forested regions of Gabon, northern Congo, southwestern CAR and southeastern Cameroon contained the region’s highest elephant densities and almost all the nationally important elephant populations, while most of DRC, eastern Congo and southern CAR had very low densities (Fig. 1). The most country-specific important sites for elephants are as follows: in Gabon, most of the National Parks and their surroundings (often Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions), especially all of those in the centre and northeast of the country, plus a long section along the coast. In Congo, about half of the north of the country can be classed as an important elephant site, including not only the National Parks of Odzala and Nouabale-Ndoki (and the soon-to-be declared Ntokou-Pikounda National Park) but several huge areas of FSC certified timber concessions that connect and surround these Parks. In the Central African Republic, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park, and in Cameroon the whole of the southeast corner of the country, which includes three National Parks and large areas of FSC-certified logging concessions. Finally, the two significant sites in DRC are the Okapi Faunal Reserve and the Salonga National Park, with smaller but still significant numbers in some of the other forest areas (including one which may soon be gazetted as a protected area, known as the Tshuapa-Lomami area).</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In areas where there is little or no poaching, elephant density is usually 0.5–1.0/km<sup>2</sup> (data included in this study). Using a conservative density of 0.5 elephants/km<sup>2</sup>, historically the 2.2 million km<sup>2</sup> Central African forest could have harboured over a million individuals [28,41] (Fig. 7). Even in 1993, it was estimated that roughly half of this projected original population remained [41] (based on their model predictions). Our analysis suggests that in 2011 just 10% (ca. 100,000 individuals) still survive (99,869 with 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (49,867–187,340) for the predictive model shown in Fig. 1b). Gabon maintains 30–50% of its probable historical numbers; DRC only 1% - it was thought that DRC originally contained almost 60% of all forest elephants, and had 40% in 1989 [41].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Discussion</span></span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Elephants have been recently extirpated from extensive areas of Africa [30,34,46,47,48] and even sites thought to be well-protected are no longer safe from ivory poaching [32]. Bouché et al.’s (2011) study examined the West and Central African savannahs, and showed that the once large savannah elephant populations had been reduced to several small pockets of a few hundred animals in many cases, with only about 7,000 individuals remaining in total. Shortly after that publication, in early 2012, several hundred elephants were killed in a matter of a few months, in the Park holding most of Cameroon’s savannah elephants [49,50]; the poachers were well-armed and on horseback. In mid-November 2012, the same poachers were heading back to the same Park – but the Cameroon army were alerted before they arrived [51]. In February 2013, the Gabonese Government announced the loss of at least half of the elephants in Minkebe National Park; as many as 11,000 individuals may have been killed between 2004 and 2012 [52]. The rapid increases in demand for, and price of, ivory in China, and the ease of sale of ivory in China [37,38], the persistent lack of effective governance in Central Africa [53] and a proliferation of unprotected roads that provide access to hunters [54,55] combine to facilitate illegal ivory poaching, transport and trade. Forest elephant population and range will continue to decline unless conditions change dramatically. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Other threats and management issues also affect forest elephants. Unlike other tropical forests, deforestation is very low in Central Africa, although increasing [56,57]. Nevertheless, land use pressure, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict also threaten this species [16] and will likely increase as industrial agriculture, such as oil palm for biofuel production, develops in the near future in Africa in general and Central Africa in particular [58,59]. While these management issues will likely increase with accelerating land use changes, the immediate, and very serious threat to the persistence of this species remains ivory poaching.</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Our analysis identified several factors likely to contribute to decline and demonstrated the importance of law enforcement for persistence of elephants. Similar factors were also found to be important in recent analyses of a very different dataset- carcass data from the MIKE sites [16,33] – where higher levels of elephant poaching, as expressed by the proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) were associated with sites where law enforcement capacity was lower, and in countries with poor governance. Governance in our study was represented by the CPI [45], whereas the MIKE analysis up to 2009 [33] incorporated both CPI and several government effectiveness indicators used by the World Bank (which can be found in their website </span><a class="link_ref" href="HYPERLINK"></a><span class="page_number">). However, in 2012, the MIKE analysis used only the CPI as the proxy for governance [16]. Because the CPI is strongly associated with other factors within countries (rule of law, governance, development), it may be considered as a proxy for overall functioning of civil society of each country, and indeed development variables associated with poverty were also found to be associated with PIKE in both 2009 and 2012 [16,33]. A previous analysis using data from the African Elephant Database [60] suggesting a link between elephant decline and poor governance was criticized [61], because latitude was a better explanatory variable and the data were collected using different methods of varying quality [4,47]. The more recent analysis using the 2007 AED showed that the “country” variable, a complex interaction of human development and governance factors, explained elephant density very well [30]. In contrast to the AED’s quite variable data, we used highly comparable data obtained within a single vegetation type (closed canopy forest). Corruption in general is increasingly a focus of international attention, whether in the wildlife realm [62-64] or more broadly [65]. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Currently the Red List classifies African elephants (<span style="font-style:italic">L. africana</span>) as Vulnerable, and the Central African population as Endangered [4]. Current losses (62% between 2002-2011) combined with previous losses [28,41] indicate a decline of more than 80% in less than two elephant generations, ca. 25 years [47]. The criterion for listing a species as Critically Endangered is when that species has declined by &gt;80% in ten years, or three generations, whichever is the longer. If, conservatively, there were half a million forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1937 (three elephant generations ago) then about 80% have now been lost. The causes of the decline are unlikely to abate in the short term, and indeed may worsen. This strongly suggests consideration of an uplisting of the Central African forest elephant subpopulation status to Critically Endangered, under the IUCN red list criteria A4b,d (population reduction, and current and projected levels of exploitation) [66].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Remaining large landscapes of major importance for elephants comprise national parks embedded in land-use matrices including logging concessions, where wildlife guards operate in both park and concession [67,68]. However, current site-based interventions in the region are generally inadequate to protect elephants, because conservation budgets are below that needed to achieve management success [42,69] and local interventions do not mitigate macro-scale threats (i.e. infrastructure development, governance issues, and ivory demand). Effective multi-level action is imperative to save forest elephants. We strongly agree with the recommendations of the African Elephant Action plan, of which the highest priority objective was the reduction of poaching and trade in elephant products. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">In 2012, China submitted a document to CITES on how it will improve its internal ivory trade [70], as internal and international awareness of the problem grows [16,35,36,71]. China’s wildlife officials, among others, attended a wildlife anti-trafficking workshop in Gabon in early 2012 [72]. At the 2012 World Conservation Congress, two specific resolutions were passed [73,74] to enhance the protection of elephants both in the range states and in the ivory-consuming countries, and a specific wildlife-crime related resolution was passed at the same time [75]. In November 2012, the US State department clearly outlined a zero-tolerance approach to wildlife crime [76,77] and many governments, INTERPOL, the World Customs Association and others are collaborating in international efforts to curb ivory (and other wildlife product) trafficking [63,78]- partly for the wildlife itself, and also because the strong links with global organised crime and security are recognised [64,79]. These diplomatic efforts are critical, but we emphasize the importance of <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> enforcement investment to protect the remaining populations of this species. However, curbing demand for ivory is key, if forest elephants are to survive. </span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We modelled temporal and spatial trends using data collected during 13,000 km of elephant-dung foot-surveys in 80 sites during 91,600 person-days from 2002 to 2011 (Fig. S3 shows temporal coverage). Field protocol followed the standardized 2003 methods of the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) [80] program of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Surveys covered the five countries holding the majority (95%) [43] of extant forest elephant range: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Republic of Congo (Congo), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Gabon, across 257,145 km<sup>2 </sup>(about 12% of Central Africa’s forests; Table S1, Figs 5 and 6). There were 9, 5, 25, 22 and 19 surveys in each country with ca. 11%, 2%, 26%, 43% and 18% of total effort (13,000 km) and ca. 4%, 6%, 32%, 41% and 17% of the total area covered (257,145 km<sup>2</sup>). For sites surveyed more than once, only the most recent data was used. In just over 25% of sites surveyed wildlife guards were absent. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">All surveys were carried out independently for site-based or landscape-based conservation needs. Limited resources for these purposes resulted in surveys being restricted to areas known or suspected to harbour wildlife, but with very variable elephant densities. Over half of the surveys were of existing or prospective protected areas, and the rest were areas in logging concessions, or with potential for wildlife conservation. Although there were some sites where elephant populations were known to be very low, few sites thought to be completely devoid of them were surveyed. Survey data was obtained across the range of values for each of the covariates considered in the analysis. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Either standard systematic line-transect distance sampling surveys (perpendicular distance to each dung pile recorded) [81], or systematic reconnaissance surveys [82] (elephant dung only recorded within a metre of the centre line) were walked. Both transect and recce survey designs allowed for random placement of the sampling units being drawn up using Distance software [83], and orientation of both transects and recces were perpendicular to roads, and major rivers to potentially improve precision. Usually at least 15 transects per stratum were used; usually more, giving reasonable replication to ensure a representative sample was obtained. Transects and recces were usually placed systematically with a random start across the entire area surveyed. At some sites both recces and transects were walked; we have used only the transect data for these sites. Data from recce surveys were used when straight lines were walked, thereby ensuring minimal bias. Other data from less strict recces (where roads or elephant paths might have been used) were not used in the analysis. Most recces were from areas known to have high hunting pressure (and thus low wildlife density). This is because transects are much more expensive to implement than recces. Occasionally, recces were done in areas where resources for a transect survey were not available at the time. Transect data were truncated to one metre of the centre line using the Distance software and the resulting plot checked to ensure that detection was 100% within that distance [83]. For reconnaissance data, detectability of dung piles was assumed certain within the narrow sampling strip (one metre each side of the observer). </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-style:italic">Data Analysis</span></span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Statistical modelling</span>. We assessed known or suspected drivers of elephant density and distribution [16,17,30,33,54,55] using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [84] due to their flexibility and capacity for non-linear responses.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">The standardized response variable was elephant dung pile counts within one metre of the centre line, adjusted for survey effort. GAMs were fit to elephant dung pile count data of the form:</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">where for the <span style="font-style:italic">i</span><sup>th</sup> survey site: <img class="paper-body-figure" src="/resource_proxy/figures/Hvn23WRi3cbvxANkKSnpTaCj/detail" alt="Figure: resource5.png" id="figure_11" data-figure-id="11"> denotes number of elephant dung piles detected, <img class="paper-body-figure" src="/resource_proxy/figures/AVtuZrHrtErEg3YWYWCQyr3v/detail" alt="Figure: resource6.png" id="figure_12" data-figure-id="12"> aggregate survey effort, <img class="paper-body-figure" src="/resource_proxy/figures/6Er3A7DyALdqC9JM9DnWMjB6/detail" alt="Figure: resource3.png" id="figure_13" data-figure-id="13"> area effectively surveyed, <img class="paper-body-figure" src="/resource_proxy/figures/H1vVTxX7ATdaJr2rNq7rXqeX/detail" alt="Figure: resource2.png" id="figure_14" data-figure-id="14"> the intercept, and <img class="paper-body-figure" src="/resource_proxy/figures/s1quCdzC1Ptftsokc7KaxhdS/detail" alt="Figure: resource1.png" id="figure_15" data-figure-id="15"> a smooth function of the <span style="font-style:italic">j</span><sup>th</sup> explanatory variable<img class="paper-body-figure" src="/resource_proxy/figures/TRZrU33z3FJiKADxmRGcR7EP/detail" alt="Figure: resource4.png" id="figure_16" data-figure-id="16">. By including area surveyed as an offset term in the model, elephant dung density is in effect being modelled. A negative binomial distribution was used to deal appropriately with severe over-dispersion in the count data. The scale parameter theta of the negative binomial was treated as unknown and an interval of (1,3) over which to search for theta was specified. Thin plate regression splines were used to fit the smooth functions, where the ‘performance iteration’ method was used for smoothing parameter estimation. To avoid overfitting, given the limited number of data points (80 survey sites), the gamma parameter was set to a value of 1.4 for all models, which forced the model to be smoother than it might otherwise have been [84]. With the limited number of data points (80 sites across years) it was not possible to account for the nested nature of sites within countries by means of a hierarchical model structure; instead country was simply included as a factor variable. The models were fit in R [85] using the <span style="font-style:italic">mgcv</span> package. </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Competing models, i.e. those with different covariates, were ranked by increasing Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE) criterion [84]. The significance of explanatory variables (based on the P-values returned for each of the terms in the GAM), percent deviance explained by the model and model fit diagnostics (Normal Q-Q, residuals vs. linear predictor, histogram of residuals, response vs. fitted values) were also considered [84]. Model selection was based on the UBRE criterion [84].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Models where survey year was modelled by country served to examine country-specific changes over the period 2002-2011. There were indications of country specific changes over time (Fig. S4 shows how the decline in DRC is potentially more extreme than in Gabon, for example). However, given the sparseness of the time series for Cameroon and in particular CAR and the lack of data points for Congo and DRC at the beginning of the period (Fig. S3), we did not incorporate country specific changes over time in the final models used to predict dung density across the Central African forests. Instead we restricted our predictions to models with the same smooth function for temporal change across the Central African forests. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Given the similarity in UBRE scores for the top models, we estimated elephant dung density using each of them (Table S2). The bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are also shown. The confidence limits are wide and the percent coefficients of variation were frequently larger than 100 (this was particularly the case for models including HII with the exception of models HII 3 and HII 5 in 2011). When models contained survey year (the proxy for temporal change), we estimated elephant dung density in both 2002 and in 2011, rather than just obtaining an average for the 2002-2011 period, which allowed us to calculate rates of decline and percent range loss from these models; estimates of the percentage of extremely low elephant density range overall and by country for 2002 and 2011 are also given (Table S3). </span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number">Variance and percentile confidence intervals of elephant abundance estimates were estimated using a combination of nonparametric and parametric bootstrapping [86]. A total of 999 bootstraps were conducted during which replicate survey sites, assumed to be independently and identically distributed, were resampled at random and with replacement until each bootstrap resample was the same size as the original number of 80 survey sites (nonparametric component). Dung abundance estimates were obtained from these resampled data conditioned on the original model fit. Dung abundance estimates were converted to elephant abundance by applying conversion factors (described below) with associated total variance obtained by incorporating the variance associated with the conversion factors. During each iteration of the bootstrap routine, conversion factor values were generated from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated value of the conversion factor and the variance equal to the squared value of the associated standard error (parametric component). Estimates of elephant numbers were ordered from smallest to largest and the 25<sup>th</sup> and 975<sup>th</sup> value was used to define the percentile confidence interval. The coefficient of variation was obtained by dividing the square root of the variance of the abundance estimates from the resampled data predictions by the mean of those abundance estimates. </span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">We defined extremely low density areas where dung density fell between 0-100 dung piles/ km<sup>2</sup> (in practice this approximates to &gt; 0.1 dung pile encountered per km walked) based on knowledge of areas within Central Africa which have extremely few or no elephants remaining (in part relying on design-based estimates of dung abundance). All of the areas where we already knew that there were extremely few or no elephants (from historical surveys, from some of these surveys included here, or from other surveys not included in this dataset), such as the majority of the southern Republic of Congo, and the majority of the forests in western Cameroon, fell into this density class, giving us confidence in the model’s ability to predict elephant range where there are almost no elephants left.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Conversion factors.</span> Dung density estimates were converted to elephant numbers using estimated production and decay rates since actual rates are notoriously difficult to collect ([87]) and were not available at every site. A production rate of 19.77 dung piles/day (standard error (SE) = 0.23) [88], also suggested by the rainfall regime of much of the area [89], was used. The same rate was also used to assess historical forest elephant loss up to 1989 [41], ensuring comparative differences were not a function of this model assumption. To ensure that the decay rate used in the conversion was representative of our sites that ranged widely in space and time, we used the mean (81.82 days, SE = 6.68 days) of fourteen estimates of dung disappearance time for different seasons, habitats and sites. No particular geographical pattern for decay rate from west to east across the basin was evident in these studies, and the associated variance was low enough to make us more confident in our application of this as a standard conversion factor, whilst recognising that there is variation within decay rates associated with season, sunspots, and rainfall [90,91,92]. To convert dung to elephant density, only dung piles not in a late stage of decomposition (“class E” of [93] are generally included. For this dataset dung density was reduced by 32.1% (SE = 3.7%), the mean percent of dung piles classified as “E”, before estimating elephant density.</span></p>
      <p class="SOM Text"><span class="page_number"><span style="font-weight:bold">Explanatory variables</span>. Explanatory variables used in the GAM analysis were (Table S4) [94]: (i)<span style="font-style:italic"> site-level </span>at the scale of individual sampling units, (ii) <span style="font-style:italic">country-level </span>(including country itself), and (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">regional proxies</span> latitude and longitude to capture possible geographical gradients in density not captured by other variables. Variables were either recorded at each survey site (hunter-sign frequency, survey year, presence/absence of guards), retrieved from reports (official protection reflecting the degree of potential protection) and online databases (Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index [45], or from GIS data layers (distance-based for poacher access, i.e., proximity to major roads; pressure-based for poacher numbers, i.e., human population density [95], the Human Influence Index [44]. Square root transformations for hunter-sign frequency and human population density were considered due to possible undue leverage from the few high values. The predicted likely influence on elephant density for each of the explanatory variable is given (Table S4). Assumptions implicit in the choice of these variables were based on previous work [16,17,33,54,55]. We assumed that both direct hunting pressure (as measured by encounter rate of hunter sign) and measures of human population density and activity (as measured by distance to the nearest road, human population density, and the human influence index) results in elephants moving away from human-dominated areas and/or being killed by poachers. We assumed that official protection of a site (such as National Park status) would reflect real protection, in other words that elephants would be more likely to be at higher densities in such sites. We assumed that if guards were present at a site, that they were actually effective in deterring poaching. We assumed that our measure of governance (CPI) reflected the suite of social, economic, and development factors associated with each country; governance and development had previously been shown to be associated with elephant poaching by the two MIKE analyses in 2009 and 2012 [16,33].</span></p>
      <p class="Body"><span class="page_number">Pearson's product-moment correlation tests (two-sided) with null hypothesis that true correlation is equal to zero were conducted for each pair-wise combination of explanatory variables considered. Variables were considered significantly correlated at the 5% level. Correlations between variables were taken into account to avoid the inclusion of highly correlated variables in the same model. Model prediction was limited to Central African forested regions, including swamp forest [96], in the five countries with survey sites. GIS grids were created at a resolution of approximately 1x1 km<sup>2</sup>, and prediction was carried out at the same resolution. </span></p>

The dung density (per km<sup>2</sup>) intervals are unequal and correspond to the following elephant population categories: extremely low density (0-100), very low (100-250), low (250-500), medium (500-1,000), high (1,000-3,000) and very high (3,000-7,500). With the loss of very high elephant populations in 2011, there is a significant shift into the lower density intervals over the nine years.</span></p>
