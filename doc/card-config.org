**Open Questions
 - Cards need to belong to a journal now (as of merging 8972 into master).  When we're seeding cards,
 are we going to just seed the same cards for every journal?  Are we going to pick a journal?  For now
 `Journal.first` is hard coded into the `CardSeeder` code

**Reviewer Reports
Reviewer reports will link to two different kinds of cards, based on which type of task made them.
- [ ] Migrate FrontMatterReviewerReportTask and ReviewerReportTask reports to different cards
- [ ] ReviewerReportTask needs to load the appropriate card for its Report, like authors, etc.
